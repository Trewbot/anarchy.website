title: Psychopathy, Sociopathy, & Demonization
---

While this work is intended as a discussion on the term "sociopathy" and its
usage in our language today, one can hardly discuss sociopathy without
first discussing psychopathy as the terms are "virtually synonymous"[^6] and the
latter predates the former. The history of the two terms is heavily linked and
so to fully distinguish them as terms that are used rather than simply noting
the difference in their definitions, we must first explore the history of the
terms themselves.

## I. _The History_

Attempting to start at the beginning has its problems as
it may be difficult to determine the exact point at which people began to define
the concept that was called "psychopathy" throughout the 20<sup>th</sup>
century. Millon et al. state that the first comparable representation of
psychopathy (more specifically they reference it as a close representation of
antisocial personality disorder) was Theophrastus' (Θεόφραστος) concept of "The
Unscrupulous Man"[^11]:

[^11]: Theodore Millon, Erik Simonsen, and Morten Birket-Smith, "[Historical
       Conceptions of Psychopathy in the United States and Europe,][9]" in
       _Psychopathy: Antisocial, Criminal, and Violent Behavior,_ ed. Theodore
       Millon, et al. (New York: The Guilford Press, 1998), 3.

> "_The Unscrupulous Man will go and borrow more money from a creditor he has
  never paid.... When marketing he reminds the butcher of some service he has
  rendered him and, standing near the scales, throws some meat, if he can, and
  a soup-bone. If he succeeds, so much the better; if not, he will snatch a
  piece of tripe and go off laughing._"

This example, however, points to what turns out to be a constant issue with
ideas of psychopathy (and later sociopathy) in that it frames crime as
contextually ambivalent; here a person who commits crime that is legally (often
not even morally or socially) considered wrong is a psychopath, regardless of
their motivation. This may simply be a matter of brevity as providing such
context and describing reasons that could justify a person's actions would
lengthen the example tenfold. Nonetheless, there is a significant lack of such
considerations especially among the older references to psychopathy.

It is at times uncertain in literature regarding the history of psychopathy
whether the author is discussing the presence of actual psychological disorder
in the population or the presence of an understanding of that psychological
disorder; perhaps this merely comes with the territory of analyzing history
through literature. This is further muddled by the tendency to cite fictional
villains as opposed to actual historical accounts of real humans suffering from
a disorder[^9]<sup>,</sup>[^10]. These include such examples as Alex DeLarge
from _A Clockwork Orange_, Hannibal Lecter from _Silence of the Lambs_, Norman
Bates from _Psycho_, and Freddy Krueger from _A Nightmare on Elm Street_;
characters ranging from empty husks designed to have the audience's ideas of
fear projected onto them to those who exist solely to exemplify the issue with
such naïve perceptions. To remedy this somewhat, we'll focus on ideas that led
to the original coining of the terms until we reach the point at which said
coining happened, then we'll cover how attempts to define the terms themselves
evolved alongside psychology and sociology; we will also be using the assumption
that whatever psychological disorders do exist have always existed in more or
less the same fashion.

Prior to the 19<sup>th</sup> century, it was thoroughly believed that the mind
and reason were one in the same, this concept came into question with Philippe
Pinel who described certain cases he studied as "insanity without delirium"
(_manie sans délire_)[^20]. He described this idea further as retaining reason
and understanding while being controlled by some unknown and powerful emotional
force. Benjamin Rush in 1812 and James Cowles Prichard in 1835 furthered this
concept to more specifically pertain to morality, the latter credited with the
formalization of "moral insanity." This imposition of moral positions on a
previously morally neutral concept was eventually criticized by Daniel Hack Tuke
in 1892, proposing the terminology be changed to "inhibitory insanity" to
realign the concept to Pinel's original conception of an emotional affection
that drives a person regardless of conscious reasoning[^21].

[^20]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 4.
[^21]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 6.

As an aside, before Prichard there was Carl Otto in 1825-1827 who had attempted
to describe Pinel's idea of insanity without delirium from the perspective of
phrenology, leading Millon et al. to describe his efforts in the following
statement: "Applying phrenology, Otto gave a surprisingly modern description of
the psychopathic mind."[^19] This should, if anything, be a massive red flag to
the idea of psychopathy in general, given that phrenology is generally
considered to be a completely useless field of pseudo science and will be
discussed (along with physiognomy and craniography) in
[Section III](#iii-the-pseudo-sciences).

</div>

Henry Maudsley, unlike Tuke, continued along the path carved out by Prichard
rather than attempting to return to the intentions of Pinel, with ideas similar
to those of Otto but deviating from the paradigm of phrenology. As such, he
argued for a biological basis for "natural moral feelings[^22]." While
Maudsley's belief at the time was that individuals and families suffering from
degeneration (as per [Bénédict Morel][16]'s theory) would simply die off on
their own eventually[^23], over time he shifted towards a eugenicist view,
believing that such illnesses needed to be purged manually. For the sake of
brevity[^24], we'll skip the works of Cesare Lombrose[^22], perhaps to be
revisited at a later date for his contributions to
criminology[^25]<sup>,</sup>[^26]<sup>,</sup>[^27].

    "[T]he concept of psychopathy eventually found its home not in psychiatry
    [&hellip;] but in criminology."
</div>
-->

Unsurprisingly,
the concept of psychopathy eventually found its home not in psychiatry, not in
therapy[^12], not in the hearts of those who sought to help inflicted
individuals better themselves, but in criminology. Specifically the section of
criminology that tackles "the problem of explaining crime and criminal behavior,
which is the problem of scientifically accounting for the presence of crime and
criminals in society.[^13]" Of course, in a society that had in the not so
distant past claimed laws to be backed by divine right, one could see how the
breaching of law would be seen to some extent as an absurd act against human
nature. If laws are inherent to human society, or to the universe even, then it
would be against the nature of humans to break laws, and therefore deviant[^14].

[^12]: Supposedly this was not intentional, but a result of psychopathy being
       considered untreatable; however, given what we now know about the
       broadness of this concept and the possibilities of treating personality
       disorders, it is more likely that it was merely considered untreatable to
       avoid investing resources in caring for difficult individuals.

       _Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology_ 50, 1 (Summer 1959): 3-19.

[^14]: Psychological disorders are often defined as a condition that consists of
       sufficient deviance from the norm, dysfunction, distress, and danger,
       collectively referred to as "the Four Ds."

       "Four D's" of Diagnoses,][11]" _Internet Journal of Psychiatry_ 1, 1
       (2009).

Hervey M. Cleckley is often described as the pioneer of the modern (primarily late
20<sup>th</sup> century) conception of psychopathy[^9]<sup>,</sup>[^15].

[^15]: Diane Kratz, "[Ever Wonder What the Difference Between a Sociopath and
       Psychopath?,][12]" Profiles of Murder, accessed Sep. 28, 2018.

> "_When the first edition of this book was written it had for many years been
  customary to use the term sexual psychopath to designate homosexuals, sadists,
  masochists, and also people specifically inclined towards exhibitionism,
  voyeurism, fetishism, cross-dressing, and pedophilia. Included at times with
  these deviations under the concept of sexual psychopathy were also types of
  abnormal behavior designated as erotomania and sexual immaturity. For many
  years before and after the initial publication of the_ Mask of Sanity _this
  custom had authoritative sanction in our nomenclature._[^7]"

[^7]: Hervey M. Cleckley, _The Mask of Sanity_ 5<sup>th</sup> edition (1988),
      286.

While attempts to define ASPD do draw from the central idea of psychopathy[^16],
the attempts at formalization as a personality disorder are put under greater
scrutiny than those that simply seek to create a checklist for psychopathy. This
is due to the concept of psychopathy itself being generally considered informal.

[^16]: See, for example, this report for the Axis II Work Group of the Task
       Force on _DSM&mdash;IV_ (why does anyone let Hare talk about this?):

       Robert D. Hare, Stephen D. Hart, and Timothy J. Harpur, "[Psychopathy and
       the _DSM&mdash;IV_ Criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder,][13]"
       _Journal of Abnormal Psychology_ 100, 3 (Aug. 1991): 391-398.

## II. _The Distinction of "Sociopathy"_

The trivial, etymological analysis of what "sociopathy" means would indicate
that it simply refers to someone who has a disconnect with society; the _socio-_
prefix meaning "regarding society"[^4] and the _-path_ suffix meaning
"disorder"[^5].

[^4]: ["socio-,"][3] Wiktionary, accessed Sep. 27, 2018.

[^5]: ["-path,"][4] Wiktionary, accessed Sep. 27, 2018.

Sociopathy is commonly used synonymously with Antisocial Personality Disorder
(APD/ASPD)[^1] and due to the nature of personality disorders[^2] also more
loosely associated with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD).
This tangential association is primarily due to conceptual overlaps between ASPD
and NPD, both connotatively and clinically[^3].

[^1]: ["Sociopathy,"][1] Psychology Today, accessed Sep. 27, 2018.

[^2]: Personality disorders are known to have high rates of comorbidity, meaning
      that a person with any given personality disorder has a higher chance of
      also having another personality disorder than a person without a
      personality disorder.

[^3]: Stephen A. Diamond Ph.D., "[Is It Narcissism or Sociopathy?,][2]"
      Psychology Today, Jul. 19, 2017.

## III. _The Pseudo Sciences_

While it may be philosophically a valid position to view law as objective and
thus assumed to necessarily exist, doing so would be at odds with the
philosophical principles of science; based on that idea, any criminal diagnosis
should be considered wholly separate from psychology as a science. However, that
is not to say it is invalid to scientifically explore cases where such
assertions on the nature of society are assumed true, rather that it is invalid
to assume such cases are applicable to cases where one cannot reasonable assume
said assertion is true. It is tempting to brush this off as the primitiveness of
the past, a fallacy far too many fall into, to assume humans hadn't a clue what
they were doing until just yesterday. In this case we can look to Peter
Kropotkin, a man fairly prominent in various circles in his time, who in 1886
wrote[^18]:

[^18]: Peter Kropotkin, "Law and Authority," 1886.

       Peter Kropotkin, "[Law and Authority,][15]" _Kropotkin's Revolutionary
       Pamphlets_, ed. Roger N. Baldwin (Vanguard Press, 1927).

> "_Cleverly assorted scraps of spurious science are inculcated upon the
   children to prove necessity of law; obedience to the law is made a religion;
   moral goodness and the law of the masters are fused into one and the same
   divinity. The historical hero of the schoolroom is the man who obeys the law,
   and defends it against rebels._"

In the words of Murray Bookchin "[t]he assumption that what currently exists
must necessarily exist is the acid that corrodes all visionary thinking[^17]."

[^17]: Murray Bookchin, "[The Meaning of Confederalism,][14]" _Green
       Perspectives_ 20 (1990).

## IV. _The Conclusion_

These terms, psychopathy and sociopathy, originate as _explanations of criminal
behavior_ rather than psychological analysis of observed personality traits, and
so they serve not to describe an individual as one who suffers from a mental
illness but as one who either seems as if or evidently is prone to criminal
acts. By allowing these two ideas, psychology and criminology, to exist
simultaneously in a given term and to use said term widely and offhandedly only
serves to demonize mental illness and to write off transgressions as
psychologically inclined (rather than socially motivated) behavior.
