While this work is intended as a discussion on the term "sociopathy" and its
usage in our public lexicon today, one can hardly discuss sociopathy without
first discussing psychopathy as the terms are "virtually synonymous"[^6] and the
latter predates the former.

It may be difficult to determine the exact point at which people began to define
the concept that was called "psychopathy" throughout the 20<sup>th</sup>
century. Millon et al. state that the first comparable representation of
psychopathy (more specifically they reference it as a close representation of
antisocial personality disorder) was Theophratus' concept of "The Unscrupulous
Man"[^11].

       Conceptions of Psychopathy in United States and Europe,][9]" in
       _Psychopathy: Antisocial, Criminal, and Violent Behavior,_ ed. Theodore
       Millon, et al. (New York: The Guilford Press, 1998), 3.

It is at times uncertain in literature regarding the history of psychopathy
whether the author is discussing the presence of actual psychological disorder
in the population or the presence of an understanding of that psychological
disorder; perhaps this merely comes with the territory of analyzing history
through literature.
This is further muddled by the tendency to cite fictional villains as opposed to
actual historical accounts of real humans suffering from a
disorder[^9]<sup>,</sup>[^10].

The concept of psychopathy eventually found its home not in psychiatry, not in
therapy[^12], not in the hearts of those who sought to help inflicted
individuals better themselves, but in criminology. Specifically the section of
criminology that tackles "the problem of explaining crime and criminal behavior,
which is the problem of scientifically accounting for the presence of crime and
criminals in society.[^13]" Of course, in a society that had in the not so
distant past claimed laws to be backed by divine right, one could see how the
breaching of law would be seen to some extent as an absurd act against human
nature. If laws are inherent to human society, or to the universe even, then it
would be against the nature of humans to break laws, and therefore deviant[^14].

[^12]: Supposedly this was not intentional, but a result of psychopathy being
       considered untreatable; however, given what we now know about the
       broadness of this concept and the possibilities of treating personality
       disorders, it is more likely that it was merely considered untreatable to
       avoid investing resources in caring for difficult individuals.

[^14]: Psychological disorders are often defined as a condition that consists of
       sufficient deviance from the norm, dysfunction, distress, and danger,
       collectively referred to as "the Four Ds."

> _"When the first edition of this book was written it had for many years been
  customary to use the term sexual psychopath to designate homosexuals, sadists,
  masochists, and also people specifically inclined towards exhibitionism,
  voyeurism, fetishism, cross-dressing, and pedophilia. Included at times with
  these deviations under the concept of sexual psychopathy were also types of
  abnormal behavior designated as erotomania and sexual immaturity. For many
  years before and after the initial publication of the_ Mask of Sanity _this
  custom had authoritative sanction in our nomenclature._[^7]"

The trivial, etymological analysis of what "sociopathy" means would indicate
that it simply refers to someone who has a disconnect with society; the _socio-_
prefix meaning "regarding society"[^4] and the _-path_ suffix meaning
"disorder"[^5].

Sociopathy is commonly used synonymously with Antisocial Personality Disorder
(APD/ASPD)[^1] and due to the nature of personality disorders[^2] also more
loosely associated with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD).
This tangential association is primarily due to conceptual overlaps between ASPD
and NPD, both connotatively and clinically[^3].

[^2]: Personality disorders are known to have high rates of comorbidity, meaning
      that a person with any given personality disorder has a higher chance of
      also having another personality disorder than a person without a
      personality disorder.
