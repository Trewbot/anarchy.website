## Introduction

There exists a tendency in a major portion of our modern speech, and language in
general, to uphold oneself in contrast to some general group considered to be
inferior. This is commonly referred to as "punching down" and we see it in terms
such as "lame" or "dumb" being used as insults. To a further extent we see the
concept of (general) intelligence used as a basis for many of these, see
"stupid," "moron," and "imbecile" for example. A lot of this is more cultural
and abstract than any sort of direct denotation, people merely call others these
terms as a means of brushing them off as intellectually inferior without any
further thought. However, at the end of this abstract concept we find terms like
"retarded" where people are much more willing to delve into an actual definition
of the word to further their attempt at insult, they'll double down and explain
that they are calling the person "slow" or "intellectually underdeveloped." This
is not to say that this never happens with the previous terms, but that it would
typically only happen with said terms in obscure edge cases rather than your
regular conversation. What we can determine from this is that people are in many
cases simultaneously attempting to harm someone with an immediate insult and
trying to establish an analysis by which to justify the insult. We see this more
cogently in the terms that are the focus of this work: "sociopath" and
"psychopath."

As opposed to many of the aforementioned examples, "sociopath" and "psychopath"
are unique in that they also represent a conceptual issue in the popular
perceptions of psychiatric work. This is, of course, not unique to these terms,
this trivialization of mental illness that we see in plenty of other places.
What should draw our attention here is that while many other examples of this
trivialization are primarily used as a sort of self diagnosis (such as claiming
one's self to have clinical depression due to a period of lost motivation or to
have an anxiety disorder due to an unwillingness to speak in front of crowds),
these terms are more typically used to diagnose others. In its most extreme we
see this concept manifested in news media, be it about criminals or
politicians[^81]. See, for example, a recent [Huffington Post][62] article[^82]
titled "Twitter Explodes After 'Psychopath' Donald Trump Cheers Body-Slamming
of Reporter," where the term "psychopath" is mirrored from a tweet quoted within
the content of the article, but nonetheless is used to call a politician a
psychopath based on publicly displayed views or actions.

[^81]: "Politicians are criminals though, so that's redundant" &mdash; Mark
       Twain, probably.

[^82]: Lee Morgan, "[Twitter Explodes After 'Psychopath' Donald Trump Cheers
       Body-Slamming of Reporter,][63]" Huffington Post, Oct. 19, 2018.

       This is really just a single example I'd noticed, there are plenty more
       similar examples of people calling a number of politicians "psychopaths,"
       but the effort required to compile them outweighs the amount it would add
       to this work as a whole.

Perhaps more blatant an example of this as well as an explanation of some
popular perceptions of "psychopathic personality" specifically is this passage
from chapter eight of Kurt Vonnegut's _A Man Without A Country_[^94]:

[^94]: Kurt Vonnegut, _A Man Without a Country_, ed. Deniel Simon, (New York:
       Seven Stories Press, 2005).

> _George W. Bush has gathered around him [...] psychopathic personalities, or
  PPs, the medical term for smart, personable people who have no consciences.
  To say somebody is a PP is to make a perfectly respectable diagnosis, like
  saying he or she has appendicitis or athlete’s foot. [...] PPs are
  presentable, they know full well the suffering their actions may cause others,
  but they do not care. They cannot care because they are nuts. They have a
  screw loose! [...] So many of these heartless PPs now hold big jobs in our
  federal government, as though they were leaders instead of sick. They have
  taken charge. They have taken charge of communications and the schools, so we
  might as well be Poland under occupation._

However, at the time of writing this, the most likely place you'll find either
of the topical terms is a number of articles pertaining to [Shane Dawson][64]'s
recent documentary series on the [YouTube][65] platform: [_The Mind of Jake
Paul_][66][^83].

[^83]: Shane Dawson, [_The Mind of Jake Paul_][66], YouTube, 2018

For the sake of argument and the establishment of context we'll quickly go over
some of the issues present in this documentary series; before doing so I,
reluctantly, recommend you watch at least the first two parts of the series
([link here][66]) to ensure that the points therein are properly represented
here and to understand the further context. With the due diligence done, we can
discuss the work more or less point by point.



<https://twitter.com/shanedawson/status/1047998909648265216>

<https://twitter.com/shanedawson/status/1048000624145485824>

The language discussed here is always an issue, something that comes up quite
often (especially around the time of mass shootings here in the U.S. when many
are compelled to immediately attribute the actions to mental illness[^84]), and
I've personally attempted to make the issues with it clear to those around me
but the publication of this documentary series by such a high profile content
creator brought about a new and potent wave of discourse around it.

[^84]: This particular phenomenon, that of the tragedies uniquely common to the
       United States being attributed to mental conditions supposedly
       universally common, deserves an entire discussion of its own and will not
       be discussed at any length here.

Through discussion of the concept, it became clear that we would benefit from a
more thorough work to which we could refer, one that would contain citations and
explanations so as to avoid the confusion and misunderstanding that plagues most
discussions on the internet. And so, with the encouragement of
[@CheechGuevara][59], I spent nearly the entirety of Vendémiaire CCXXVII[^79]
(and a sadly considerable bit of Brumaire as well) researching this topic to
ensure that this essay thoroughly describes the tumultuous history of the terms
psychopath and sociopath, as well as the issues with its current conception.

[^79]: I started writing this on 6 Vendémiaire CCXXVII, based on the [equinox
       method][60] for handling leap years on the Republican Calendar. And, to
       be fair, there is no shortage of times within this essay in which I must
       describe how men in positions of influence wanted entire swaths of people
       (often including myself) to be killed off, so some time to process is
       forgivable, in my opinion.

Thanks to the group chats currently or formerly known as "Sinking

with my constant complaints while researching this topic.

[^70]: For those yet unaware (\*cough\* \*cough\* Nathan), the emoji combination
       "⛽🅰️🆖" is read as "gang," older versions of ⛽ on iOS had a "G" on the
       center of the pump that was later replaced with a drop of oil and is
       completely non-standard across other emoji fonts. See [emojipedia][82]'s
       historical record of the emoji.

[^80]: The "Gesellschaftsfeinde" in the name of this group was directly inspired
       by my research during the writing of this work and is an ironic embrace
       of the concept of "antisocial" (here being literally translated as "enemy
       of society") given that the group is comprised of members who themselves
       have a variety of critiques of the modern incarnation(s) of society.

## I. _The History_

While this work is intended as a discussion on the term "sociopathy" and its
usage in our language today, one can hardly discuss sociopathy without
first discussing psychopathy as the terms are "virtually synonymous"[^6] and the
latter predates the former. The history of the two terms is heavily linked and
so to fully distinguish them as terms that are used rather than simply noting
the difference in their definitions, we must first explore the history of the
terms themselves.

[^6]: Graham Richards, _Psychology: Key Concepts,_ (Oxon: Routledge, 2009), 200.

Attempting to start at the beginning has its problems as
it may be difficult to determine the exact point at which people began to define
the concept that was called "psychopathy" throughout the 20<sup>th</sup>
century. Millon et al. state that the first comparable representation of
psychopathy (more specifically they reference it as a close representation of
antisocial personality disorder) was Theophrastus' (Θεόφραστος) concept of "The
Unscrupulous Man"[^11], sometimes also called "The Shameless Man"[^29]:

[^11]: Theodore Millon, Erik Simonsen, and Morten Birket-Smith, "[Historical
       Conceptions of Psychopathy in the United States and Europe,][9]" in
       _Psychopathy: Antisocial, Criminal, and Violent Behavior,_ ed. Theodore
       Millon, et al. (New York: The Guilford Press, 1998), 3.

> "_The Unscrupulous Man will go and borrow more money from a creditor he has
  never paid.... When marketing he reminds the butcher of some service he has
  rendered him and, standing near the scales, throws some meat, if he can, and
  a soup-bone. If he succeeds, so much the better; if not, he will snatch a
  piece of tripe and go off laughing._"

This example, however, points to what turns out to be a constant issue with
ideas of psychopathy (and later sociopathy) in that it frames crime as
contextually ambivalent; here a person who commits crime that is legally (often
not even morally or socially) considered wrong is a psychopath, regardless of
their motivation. This may simply be a matter of brevity as providing such
context and describing reasons that could justify a person's actions would
lengthen the example tenfold. Nonetheless, there is a significant lack of such
considerations especially among the older references to psychopathy.

It is at times uncertain in the literature regarding the history of psychopathy
whether the author is discussing the presence of actual psychological disorder
in the population or the presence of an understanding of that psychological
disorder; perhaps this merely comes with the territory of analyzing history
through literature. This is further muddled by the tendency to cite fictional
villains as opposed to actual historical accounts of real humans suffering from
a disorder[^9][^10]. These include such examples as Alex DeLarge
from _A Clockwork Orange_, Hannibal Lecter from _Silence of the Lambs_[^95],
Norman Bates from _Psycho_, and Freddy Krueger from _A Nightmare on Elm Street_;
characters ranging from empty husks designed to have the audience's ideas of
fear projected onto them to those who exist solely to exemplify the issue with
such naïve perceptions. To remedy this somewhat, we'll focus on ideas that led
to the original coining of the terms until we reach the point at which said
coining happened, then we'll cover how attempts to define the terms themselves
evolved alongside psychology and sociology; we will also be using the assumption
that whatever psychological disorders do exist have always existed in more or
less the same fashion.

### I-1. Conception

Prior to the 19<sup>th</sup> century, it was thoroughly believed that the mind
and reason were one in the same, this concept came into question with [Philippe
Pinel][25] who described certain cases he studied as "insanity without delirium"
(_manie sans délire_)[^20]. He described this idea further as retaining reason
and understanding while being controlled by some unknown and powerful emotional
force. [Benjamin Rush][26][^34] in 1812 and [James Cowles Prichard][28] in 1835
furthered this
concept to more specifically pertain to morality, the latter credited with the
formalization of "moral insanity." This imposition of moral positions on a
previously morally neutral concept was eventually criticized by [Daniel Hack
Tuke][29]
in 1892, proposing the terminology be changed to "inhibitory insanity" to
realign the concept to Pinel's original conception of an emotional affection
that drives a person regardless of conscious reasoning[^21].

       the Mind,_][27] (Philadelphia: Kimber & Richardson, 1812).

[^21]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 6.

As an aside, before Prichard there was Carl Otto in 1825-1827 who had attempted
to describe Pinel's idea of insanity without delirium from the perspective of
phrenology, leading Millon et al. to describe his efforts in the following
statement: "Applying phrenology, Otto gave a surprisingly modern description of
the psychopathic mind."[^19] This should, if anything, be a massive red flag to
the idea of psychopathy in general, given that phrenology is generally
considered to be a completely useless field of pseudo science and will be
discussed (along with physiognomy and craniography) in
[Section III](#iii-the-pseudo-sciences).

[^19]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 5.

[Henry Maudsley][41], unlike Tuke, continued along the path carved out by
Prichard rather than attempting to return to the intentions of Pinel, with ideas
similar to those of Otto but deviating from the paradigm of phrenology. As such,
he argued for a biological basis for "natural moral feelings[^22]." While
Maudsley's belief at the time was that individuals and families suffering from
degeneration (as per [Bénédict Morel][16]'s theory) would simply die off on
their own eventually[^23], over time he shifted towards a eugenicist view,
believing that such illnesses needed to be purged manually. For the sake of
brevity[^24], we'll skip the works of [Cesare Lombroso][42][^22], perhaps to be
revisited at a later date for his contributions to
criminology[^25][^26][^27].

Toward the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and into the 20<sup>th</sup>, the
idea of psychopathy took hold in Germany, where it took a less "value-laden"
form as it had among the British. One such German, one who stands out in the
historical context, was [Julius Ludwig August Koch][43] in 1891 who proposed
that the previous standard of "moral insanity" be replaced with his new idea of
"psychopathic inferiorities" (_Psychopathischen
Minderwertigkeiten_)[^8][^28]. He attributed this condition to
"functional organic deviations" (_organische Abweichungen funktioneller
Art_)[^32] that couldn't be rectified, a similar idea to the more modern idea of
predisposition, though more assertive and derived once again from degeneration
theory. Koch defined three degrees of severity of
psychopathy[^31][^28]:

1. Disposition (_Disposition_), characterized by tension and high sensitivity,
2. Burden (_Belastung_), by egocentrism and impulsiveness, and
3. Degeneration (_Degeneration_), by borderline states.

[^8]: Julius Ludwig August Koch, [_Die Psychopathischen Minderwertigkeiten,_][5]
      (Ravensburg: Maier, 1891).

[^28]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 8.

[^32]: The exact language used by Koch is often ambiguous and confusing, a full
       discussion into this is outside the scope of this work, for such a
       discussion see:

       Phillip Gutmann, "[Julius Ludwig August Koch (1841-1908): Christian,
       philosopher and psychiatrist,][24]" _History of Psychiatry_ 19, 2 (2008):
       202-214.

[^31]: Gutmann, "J.L.A. Koch...," 208.

From these we can gather that this classification was meant as a very broad
categorization, encompassing all personality disorders (not just
antisocial)[^28]. That analysis is reinforced by the introductory remarks of
Koch's own work which state "[t]he term 'psychopathic inferiorities' comprises
all abnormalities&mdash;either hereditary or acquired&mdash;which influence a
human's personal life, but which do not constitute&mdash;even in their worst
cases&mdash;mental illnesses.[^33]" This meaning was adopted by Kurt Schneider
as "abnormal personalities," in early conceptions of psychosis, which bears a
similarly rough history to that of psychopathy[^30].

       Aspects,][23]" _Schizophrenia Bulletin_ 34, 6 (November 2008): 1200-1210.

### I-2. Eugenics

The nosology (classification of illnesses) developed by Koch included many forms
of mental illness, providing loose distinctions between those that were
"organic" and those caused by events in one's life. For psychopathy, such a
distinction came to the forefront as [Adolf Meyer][30] proposed the concept of
"constitutional inferiority" in 1904[^28]. This phrasing, however, lost favor as
a descriptor as "inferior," despite its purely clinical intentions, gained a
harsh derogatory connotation.

![Portrait of Emil Kraepelin][73]
Emil Kraepelin<br>_Source: [Wikimedia Commons][74]._
{: .pullquote .image .left}

An alternative framing of psychopathy was provided by [Emil Kraepelin][31] in
his work _Psychiatry: A Textbook_ (_Psychiatrie: Ein Lehrbuch_)[^34], in which
he asserted the idea of "psychopathic personalities"[^41]. This conception
maintained the notion that personality disorders (psychopathy specifically here)
originate from constitutional "defects" and therefore their symptoms are
permanently a part of the affected person from birth, though Kraepelin focused
much of his efforts on socio- and psychogenic forms of degeneracy. As a
politically active psychiatrist, Kraepelin not only studied the causes of what
he deemed to be issues in society (in his case the German _Volk_) but proposed
solutions as well. These primarily took the form of education, prohibition,
improving living conditions, helping the poor, and... "reasonable policies of
racial hygiene" (_verständige Rassenhygiene_)[^37].

[^41]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 9.

[^37]: Eric J. Engstrom, "[Classic Text No. 71: 'On the Question of
       Degeneration' by Emil Kraepelin (1908),][34]" _History of Psychiatry_ 18,
       3 (2007): 389-404.

In his aforementioned magnum opus, Kraepelin originally (1899) referred to
"psychopathic states" which were, to him, a singular form of degeneration. Only
afterwards in the 7<sup>th</sup> edition (1904) did he use the term
"psychopathic personalities," which he had split into four categories at the
time[^42][^36]:

[^42]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 10.

[^36]: Marc-Antoine Crocq, "[Milestones in the history of personality
    disorders,][33]" _Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience_ 15, 2 (June 2013):
    147-153.

1. morbid/pathological liars and swindlers (_die krankhaften Ttigner und
   Schwindler_), who were essentially conmen who were charming but immoral and
   unempathetic to others' needs, suffering themselves from unfaithful memory
   and instability of emotion;
2. criminals by impulse/pseudoquerulants (_die Pseudoquerulanten_), who
   committed theft, arson, and rape on impulse, corresponding somehow to the
   modern notion of paranoid personality[^43];
3. professional/born criminals (_der Geborne Verbrecher_), who were disciplined
   and well mannered but ultimately manipulative (modeled after Lombroso and
   Prichard's conceptions);
4. and morbid vagabonds/irresolute/weak-willed (_die Haltlosen_) who simply
   stumbled through life, lacking in confidence and unable to take on
   responsibility or commit to anything.

[^43]: I'd attempted to match the analyses by Millon with those by Crocq, and by
       process of elimination drew a parallel between the former's "criminals by
       impulse" and the latter's "pseudoquerulants." This may not be perfect, as
       neither describes the members of this list in thorough enough detail, and
       I am as of yet incapable of tracking down a copy of the 7<sup>th</sup>
       edition of Kraepelin's work.

A cursory glance at this list may lead one to interpret it as more a list of
types of criminals than any sort of nosology, and to an extent one would in that
case be correct. As with many of the previous definitions, this iteration of the
psychopathy diagnosis is blatantly driven by an attempt to classify criminality
as a disease; this trend certainly does not stop here either. To further the
absurdity of _this_ definition, Kraepelin went on to expand it in the
8<sup>th</sup> edition of his work into seven categories[^42][^36]:

1. the excitable (_die Erregbaren_);
2. the irresolute (_die Haltlosen_), carried over from the last edition;
3. those who are impulsive and follow their instincts (_Triebmenschen_),
   Kraepelin would have considered periodic drinkers and those who sought out
   pleasure to be among this category since he saw alcohol and syphilis as among
   the greatest threats to the people (_Volksgiften_)[^37][^36];
4. eccentrics (_Verschobenen_);
5. pathological liars and swindlers (_die krankhaften Ttigner und Schwindler_),
   also carried over from the last edition;
6. the antisocial/enemies of society (_Gesellschaftsfeinde_);
7. and the quarrelsome (_die Streitsüchtige_).

The final three are described by Millon et al. to have "features similar to the
current notions of the antisocial,"[^42] with the sixth category being the most
similar.

Now, Kraepelin probably wasn't a "Nazi"[^39]. By some definitions, one must have
been a member of the Nationalist Socialist Party in order to have actually been
a Nazi, and Kraepelin died in 1926 leaving behind no record of ever joining said
party. Of course, that didn't stop him from supporting eugenics[^38], or ethnic
cleansing[^37], or declaring people to be mentally ill by their political
positions, or being an anti-Semite[^35], but I digress[^40].

[^39]: Though two of the doctors he mentored, [Paul Nitsche][36] and [Ernst
       Rüdin][37], were very much so. In fact, the former was executed with a
       fucking guillotine for being a Nazi.

[^40]: There's a book's worth of details on how fucked up Kraepelin was, but
       like Lombroso it would detract too much from the primary narrative here.
       For instance, he was fired from his work as a psychiatrist for neglecting
       his clinical duties; elsewhere he wrote that the reason he did not like
       doing such work was that he saw it as a waste to expend effort caring for
       those he saw as inferior while others in the world that he saw as decent
       people were suffering.

Attempts were made to separate the clinical notion of psychopathy from the value
judgements imposed on it by the likes of Koch and Kraepelin, primarily by [Kurt
Schneider][39] in post-World War I Germany (_[Weimarer Republik][40]_)[^46].
This was partially due to the observation that the personality traits that may
lead someone to criminality don't necessarily do so, and many who would have
"psychopathic personalities" weren't necessarily doomed to a life of crime; not
only were the people theorized by this analysis not all criminals living at odds
with society, many were quite successful in positions of political and social
power, according to Schneider's observations[^47]. To that end, he attempted to
use clinical/psychological terms, rather than the previously common social and
criminal terminology, defining ten categories of "abnormal personalities"[^36]:

[^46]: Richard F. Wetzell, _Inventing the Criminal: A History of German
       Criminology, 1880-1945,_ (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina
       Press, 2000), 246.

[^47]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 12.

1. hyperthymic (_Hyperthymische_),
2. depressive,
3. insecure (_Selbstunsichere_)[^48],
4. fanatical (_Fanatische_),
5. recognition-seeking (_Geltungsbedürftige_)[^48],
6. with labile mood (_Stimmungslabile_),
7. explosive (_Explosible_),
8. emotionally-blunted (_Gemütlose_),
9. weakwilled (_Willenlose_),
10. asthenics (_Asthenische_).

[^48]: This is further evidence to my theory that the internet has actually
       caused relatively little change in general social norms. Here we see
       Schneider defining mentally ill groups based on insecurity and validation
       seeking just as modern critics of social media users (especially in the
       realm of Instagram models or YouTube stars).

Schneider also held a then novel position on the distinction between normal and
abnormal personality types, being that clinically abnormal personality traits
would be meaningless to describe as extreme forms of normal ones[^36]. This sort
of definition, however, is problematic in that it draws a simple dichotomy
between "normal" and everything else, the latter group of which can come in an
infinite number of forms. Thus the previously given categories were merely a
subset defined to give focus to those abnormalities that caused suffering on
either the individual or society, the "psychopathic personalities"[^49]. As this
line is clearly arbitrarily drawn based on whether one considers specific traits
to case suffering in society, Schneider suggested work be done to study the
whole category of "abnormal personalities," but the very act of drawing said
line served to keep focus on the "psychopathic" group within it[^50].

[^50]: Wetzell, _Inventing the Criminal_, 249.

On the question of constitutionality of these personalities, Schneider fell in
line with many of the developments that preceded him. While he agreed that
environment has an effect on personality, he maintained that abnormalities in a
personality were congenital and typically hereditary[^49]. However, he did
oppose eugenics and even fought against the influence of the Nazis in psychiatry
(at least so far as defending his own department from them)[^51].

"[T]he concept of psychopathy eventually found its home not in psychiatry [...]
but in criminology."
{: .pullquote}

Unsurprisingly, despite Schneider's lackluster attempt to push against the
trend, the concept of psychopathy eventually found its home not in psychiatry,
not in therapy[^12], not in the hearts of those who sought to help inflicted
individuals better themselves, but in criminology. Specifically the section of
criminology that tackles "the problem of explaining crime and criminal behavior,
which is the problem of scientifically accounting for the presence of crime and
criminals in society.[^13]" Of course, in a society that had in the not so
distant past claimed laws to be backed by divine right, one could see how the
breaching of law would be seen to some extent as an absurd act against human
nature. If laws are inherent to human society, or to the universe even, then it
would be against the nature of humans to break laws, and therefore deviant[^14].

[^12]: Supposedly this was not intentional, but a result of psychopathy being
       considered untreatable; however, given what we now know about the
       broadness of this concept and the possibilities of treating personality
       disorders, it is more likely that it was merely considered untreatable to
       avoid investing resources in caring for difficult individuals.

[^14]: Psychological disorders are often defined as a condition that consists of
       sufficient deviance from the norm, dysfunction, distress, and danger,
       collectively referred to as "the Four Ds."

       "Four D's" of Diagnoses,][11]" _Internet Journal of Psychiatry_ 1, 1

While agreeing with many of the conclusions and observations brought forth by
Kurt Schneider, [Karl Birnbaum][38] returned to previous approaches to the idea
of psychopathy by focusing on the connection between it and criminality.
Birnbaum believed that there was such a link, regardless of how little
statistical backing there was at the time, and thus aimed to explain said link;
he did so by defining three deficiencies in psychopaths[^52]:

[^52]: Wetzell, _Inventing the Criminal_, 252.

1. reactions disproportionate to stimuli,
2. traits not harmonized,
3. and lack of psychological resilience and balance.

Between these, an afflicted person would be incapable of adapting to life, often
turning to crime as a result but not in all cases. He also claimed that there
were certain traits (among those defined by Schneider) that lent themselves to
antisocial behavior while others directly lead to outright criminal behavior.
There were also those that did not lend themselves to criminality, but could, by
situational influences, be pushed to commit crime. Along with all this, he
claimed that each abnormality was associated with a particular brand of crime as
well. These tenuous sorts of connections were, according to him, the reason why
not all psychopaths were criminals, but were merely at higher risk of becoming
as such[^52].

{: .pullquote .image .left}

Birnbaum had also in decades prior introduced the term "sociopathic" as a more
apt description of the condition theorized in Kraepelin's work. Though it was
not at all popular at the time, circa 1909, he derived the term from the idea
that antisocial behavior was only rarely directly caused by a constitutional
condition and was more commonly a result of social
conditioning[^44][^45].

       rhetoric in psychopathy research,][18]" Ph.D. Dissertation, Simon Fraser
       University, Burnaby, British Columbia, 2007.

The Danish psychiatrist August Wimmer was, like Kraepelin and those after him,
critical of degeneration theory as an explanation of presumed hereditary
criminality, and, like Kraepelin, was also concerned with "racial improvement."
The alternative he supported was that of Mendelian inheritance, more similar to
modern genetics; to that end he supported marital restrictions, sterilization,
and forced abortion to avoid the "hereditary taint" of these characteristics.
Of note, Wimmer included in his classification of psychopaths (1929) more
specific types such as the "sexually perverted" and "asocial"[^53].

[^53]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 13.

Immediately after Wimmer, though more relevant to discussion of Birnbaum, came
[George E. Partridge][45]'s review "Current Conceptions of Psychopathic
Personality" in the July of 1930, wherein he notes that the antisocial behaviors
of "psychopaths" were likely a focal point among psychiatrists merely due to
their evident nature[^54], and that this focus has also lead to disagreement as
to the actual rate at which psychopathy occurs[^55].

<!-- Talk about Freud here? let's not. -->

This critique of the field at the time came despite a recently occurring push
to once again create a coherent definition of psychopathy, this time using the
new methodology of psychoanalysis as pioneered by [Sigmund Freud][46]. In 1925,
[August Aichhorn][47] wrote that delinquency was akin to a disease and so the
criminal behaviors associated with it were merely symptoms rather than the whole
of the problem. He theorized that either too permissive or too authoritarian
parenting would create a foundation upon which such a "disease" would form later
on in life[^56].

[^56]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 15.

"Together [they] formed a character typology that would influence our modern
ideas of personality disorders."
{: .pullquote}

In the same year, this concept was further solidified under psychoanalysis by
[Karl Abraham][48] and [Wilhelm Reich][49]. Abraham asserted that antisocial
behaviors stemmed from "psychological undernourishment" as a child, thus
affecting the _libido_ such that a hatred forms to be later directed at the
whole of society. This was extended by Reich who claimed that the behaviors are
then a result of the _superego_ being incapable of retaining control of the
_ego_[^56]. Together, Freud, Abraham, and Reich formed a character typology that
would influence our modern ideas of personality disorders[^36]. Partridge also
joined into the psychoanalysis in 1927, concluding that the delinquent behavior
perceived among supposed psychopaths originated from "unfulfilled oral
needs"[^56].

### I-3. Operationalization

While the works of [Eugen Kahn][50], one of Kraepelin's assistants[^60] who did
not go on to serve the Nazis, are often overlooked in the history, the
analysis he gave in 1931 (as quoted by [David Kennedy Henderson][51]) are rather
indicative of the language used in the '30s. According to Hendersom, Kahn first
gave a simple classification in four groups[^59]:

[^60]: Hanns Hippius, Hans-Jürgen Möller, Hans-Jürgen Müller, and Gabriele
       Neundörfer-Kohl, _[The University Department of Psychiatry in Munich:
       From Kraepelin and his predecessors to molecular psychiatry][52]_
       (Heidelberg: Springer Medizin Verlag, 2008), 93.

[^59]: D. K. Henderson, _Psychopathic States_, (New York: W. W. Norton & Co.,
       1939), 21.

1. unstable egocentric (emotional instability),
2. constitutional inferiority ("habitual inadequate behavior"),
3. idiosyncratic personality,
4. and "psychotoid."

His analytical inventory is then given as three groups with several subgroups as
"quantitative deviations"[^61]:

[^61]: Henderson, _Psychopathic States_, 22.

1. impulsive, similar to the _Triebmenschen_ group defined by Kraepelin and
   specifically including "sex variants" such as masturbation, homosexuality,
   sadism, masochism, exhibitionism, fetishism, and pedophilia (keep this mildly
   infuriating list in mind as it comes up several times going forward);
2. disturbances of temperament:
   1. _hyperthymic_, similar to Schneider's hyperthymic and explosive, including
      being vivacious and cheerful;
   2. _hypothymic_, "phlegmatic" and affectless;
   3. and _dysphoric_, which Henderson claimed to possibly be close to
      _cyclothemic_, being anxious and gloomy.
3. _ego_ and character manifestations:
   1. "active autists"[^63] and the egocentric,
   2. "passive autists" and the "ego-searcher,"
   3. and "ambitendent."

[^63]: The term "autist" itself deserves a significant further discussion,
       perhaps this will spark a long series of articles on "Issues in Language
       and Psychiatry" or something along those lines.

It is noted that this system is so broad and vague that it is clinically
useless, a problem Kahn attempted to fix with a more robust list of instances
that isn't meaningfully distinguishable from Schneider's list[^62]. Henderson
himself proposed a categorization of psychopathic personalities into three
non-exclusive groups in his 1939 work[^57]:

[^62]: Henderson, _Psychopathic States_, 23.

[^57]: Henderson, _Psychopathic States_, 38.

1. Predominantly aggressive.
2. Predominantly passive or inadequate.
3. Predominantly creative.

This is another development in the movement against viewing psychopathy and
criminality as synonymous, though caused plenty of controversy due to overlap
with the passive/inadequate type and other diagnoses (specifically neuroticism),
as well as people simply disagreeing that the creative type could even be
considered a psychopath[^58].

[^58]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 16.

[Benjamin Karpman][53], in 1941, maintained the distinction of psychopathy into
two categories (similar to beliefs held by Birnbaum): "idiopathic" and
"symptomatic." Here "idiopathic" referred to the constitutional sort, where
there was a guiltless, antisocial sort of personality with not discernable
psychogenic history; "symptomatic" were a group that wasn't composed of "true
psychopaths" but rather of "neurotics 'parading' as psychopaths," where the
antisocial behavior was the result of internal conflict rather than originating
from a constitutional condition[^64]. These two groups have also been referred
to as "primary" and "secondary" psychopaths respectively[^65].

1941 also saw the publication of [Hervey M. Cleckley][58]'s _The Mask of Sanity:
An Attempt to Reinterpret Some Issues About the So-Called Psychopathic
Personality_[^92], which was his attempt to "reinterpret" some issues he saw
with people's ideas of the
"psychopathic personality." Because of the influence of this book, Cleckley is
often described as the pioneer of the modern (primarily mid to late
20<sup>th</sup> century) conception of psychopathy[^9][^15][^93] providing the
"best definition of psychopathy"[^91] and was
even in his own time considered and important contributor[^89]. Like
Schneider and Birnbaum, Cleckley did not believe that psychopaths were
universally criminal and could often be found filling roles of great importance
and power[^71]; he further aligned with Schneider in his attempts to create a
clinical definition of psychopathy, one that could be used separate from
theories of its origin[^72].

[^72]: Hildebrand, _Psychopathy..._, 6.

Rather than categorization of various sorts of psychopaths, the focus of
Cleckley's work was on the creation of a set of criteria by which a psychopath
could be diagnosed[^72]. It is because of his work on such a definition and its
similarity to how we define mental illnesses today that Cleckley is regarded so
highly (as stated earlier). There were 16 criteria in his definition[^74], the
first nine of which were "key features" and the latter seven were "other"[^73]:

[^74]: Hervey M. Cleckley, _The Mask of Sanity_ 5<sup>th</sup> edition (1988),
       338.

[^73]: This is the language used by Hildebrand, who cites Andrews and Bonta's
       _The psychology of criminal conduct_ 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. as its origin.
       This list has also been rearranged to match the order used by Hildebrand
       (on page 6) for the purposes of this categorization.

1. Unresponsive in general interpersonal relations
2. Superficial charm and good "intelligence"[^75]
3. Absence of delusions and other signs of irrational thinking
4. Absence of "nervousness" or other neurotic manifestations
5. Lack of remorse or shame
6. Poor judgment and failure to learn from experience
7. Pathological egocentricity and incapacity for love
8. General poverty in major affective reactions
9. Inadequately motivated antisocial behavior
10. Impersonal, trivial, and poorly integrated sex life
11. Unreliability
12. Failure to follow any life plan[^90]
13. Untruthfulness and insincerity
14. Suicide rarely carried out
15. Specific loss of insight
16. Fantastic and uninviting behavior with drink and sometimes without

[^75]: The quotation marks around "intelligence" are present in Cleckley's _Mask
       of Sanity_ 5<sup>th</sup> ed. but not in Hildebrand's retelling of it.

[^90]: Whom among us cannot relate though.

One may readily notice that many of those items categorized as "other features"
are nearly universally applicable depending on interpretation. Ideas like
unreliability and loss of insight point to the retention of the biases found in
many of the earlier attempts at definitions; they (even when accounting for the
further discussion offered in Cleckley's work[^76][^77]) fail to
describe anything significantly deviant from the norm but rather describe
arbitrarily more extreme forms of biases or issues any given person is likely to
experience. Unreliability can be seen as simply a lack of motivation, something
that is heavily dependent on the specific situation, and while Cleckley attempts
to distinguish this as a form of unreliability that neglects even the strongest
social obligation[^76] it remains true that there is virtually no means by which
to guarantee without a doubt someone remains motivated to any cause. The latter
example, specific loss of insight, is also described in a way that may bear some
distinction from the norm, but only so long as one does not understand that
there is no universal or objective perspective and so one's inability to see
from the perspective of those around them is not necessarily so deviant as to be
considered a disorder. Of course, these are merely two examples out of the list
of 16, but the same general critique applies to nearly all the others; though
such a harsh analysis could be easily applied to any clinical definition, the
point here remains that these were not derived in a vacuum, but rather off the
back of the aforementioned works of Kahn[^78], which were in turn derived from
those of Schneider and Kraepelin, and so the flimsiness of the definitions is
not so certainly merely due to the requirements of such definitions to be so.

[^76]: Cleckley, _The Mask of Sanity_, 340.

[^77]: Cleckley, _The Mask of Sanity_, 350.

[^78]: Cleckley, _The Mask of Sanity_, 234.

It is important to realize at this point that the efforts from hereon in the
20<sup>th</sup> century were not to reevaluate the concept of psychopathy from a
new clinical and scientific perspective but to reestablish already existing
ideas as both clinical and scientific. The distinction here is that rather than
purging all previous notions and exploring the fundamentals of a perceived
problem through scientific means, what was done was at best a meta-study of said
previous notions that was then translated into a format commonly used in
clinical contexts. That is to say that rather than exploring the origin of what
would be seen as psychopathy in a patient, these new definitions would continue
to represent an arbitrary set of "antisocial" behaviors labeled as symptoms.

"Cleckley did make some attempt to explicitly separate psychopathy from
criminality..."
{: .pullquote}

However, Cleckley did make some attempt to explicitly separate psychopathy from
criminality, drawing distinction in the fact that criminals often commit crime
for a specific end (such as the accumulation of wealth) whereas psychopaths do
so for the satisfaction of committing the crime in itself[^85]. This is a clear
improvement over some of the earliest ideas of psychopathy, but there remains
the emphasis on finding a correlation (without any statistical or often even
theoretical basis) between personality disorders and criminality. He maintains
this distinction while also admitting that the term is necessarily vague and is
most often used without such clarity[^86].

[^85]: Cleckley, _The Mask of Sanity_, 261.

[^86]: Cleckley, _The Mask of Sanity_, 263.

Plenty of the aforementioned figures had mentioned some category of "sexual
deviants," though they had merely included such a category in a wider context of
what is effectively the classification of various criminal behaviors. Starting
in the '40s, there was a more significant focus on what they then called "sexual
psychopaths." We then return to Karpman, who published a significant number of
works on this concept,
including one later in 1951 explicitly titled "The Sexual Psychopath"[^66].
Leading up to this, Karpman was the Chief Psychotherapist of the St. Elizabeths
Hospital in Washington, D.C., where he "treated" people for non-conforming
sexual and gender identities[^67]. While there, he worked to find what was then
called "latent homosexuality" in criminals, which he believed to be the core
cause of their criminality[^68]. This often took thorough analysis of every
aspect of a person's life before finally finding something indicative of such an
idea[^69], likely due to its incoherence as a concept. This development is left
out of most of the popular histories of psychopathy (such as Millon et al.),
mostly due to the focus of said histories being on ideas and concepts that
remained a part of psychopathy and not on tangents that exemplify the problems
with historical and modern definitions of it such as the narrative being
presented in this work.

[^69]: One particularly intriguing example of this, as described in _The Myth of
       the Queer Criminal_, had Karpman going so far as to state that
       professional fighting was indicative of "latent homosexuality" as it
       included a man pounding other men.

Returning to "The Sexual Psychopath," Karpman explicitly states that "[t]he
terms 'sexual psychopath' and 'sexual psychopathy' have no legitimate place in
psychiatric nosology or dynamic classification"[^87]. This comes after a lengthy
introduction in which he describes the lack of reasonable certainty in the
definition of sexual crime by both the public and the law, and that the concept
of sexual psychopathy would be reliant on such definitions[^88].

[^87]: Karpman, "The Sexual Psychopath," 186.

[^88]: Karpman, "The Sexual Psychopath," 184.

By the late '80s, the denotation of "sexual psychopath" had lost what little
favor it had retained since its denunciation by Karpman and Cleckley, as is
evident by this comment in the 5<sup>th</sup> edition of Cleckley's _Mask of
Sanity_[^7]:

> "_When the first edition of this book was written it had for many years been
  customary to use the term sexual psychopath to designate homosexuals, sadists,
  masochists, and also people specifically inclined towards exhibitionism,
  voyeurism, fetishism, cross-dressing, and pedophilia. Included at times with
  these deviations under the concept of sexual psychopathy were also types of
  abnormal behavior designated as erotomania and sexual immaturity. For many
  years before and after the initial publication of the_ Mask of Sanity _this
  custom had authoritative sanction in our nomenclature._"

While attempts to define ASPD do draw from the central idea of psychopathy[^16],
the attempts at formalization as a personality disorder are put under greater
scrutiny than those that simply seek to create a checklist for psychopathy. This
is due to the concept of psychopathy itself being generally considered informal.

[^16]: See, for example, this report for the Axis II Work Group of the Task
       Force on _DSM&mdash;IV_ (why does anyone let Hare talk about this?):

## II. _The Distinction of "Sociopathy"_

The difference between "sociopath" and "psychopath" (with regards to their
definitions) is similar to that between "pigeon" and "dove" or "crow" and
"raven."

The trivial, etymological analysis of what "sociopathy" means would indicate
that it simply refers to someone who has a disconnect with society; the _socio-_
prefix meaning "regarding society"[^4] and the _-path_ suffix meaning
"disorder"[^5].

[^4]: ["socio-,"][3] Wiktionary, accessed Sep. 27, 2018.

[^5]: ["-path,"][4] Wiktionary, accessed Sep. 27, 2018.

Sociopathy is commonly used synonymously with Antisocial Personality Disorder
(APD/ASPD)[^1] and due to the nature of personality disorders[^2] also more
loosely associated with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD).
This tangential association is primarily due to conceptual overlaps between ASPD
and NPD, both connotatively and clinically[^3].

## III. _The Pseudo-Sciences_

Earlier sections relied to various extents on the assumption that the reader is
aware of what an assortment of outdated and pseudo-scientific fields entailed as
well as the issues with said fields; this section then exists to clarify any
confusion that would have resulted in the case of these assumptions being
untrue.

### III-1. Phrenology

### III-2. Degeneration Theory

### III-3. Physiognomy

### III-4. Criminology

While it may be philosophically a valid position to view law as objective and
thus assumed to necessarily exist, doing so would be at odds with the
philosophical principles of science; based on that idea, any criminal diagnosis
should be considered wholly separate from psychology as a science. However, that
is not to say it is invalid to scientifically explore cases where such
assertions on the nature of society are assumed true, rather that it is invalid
to assume such cases are applicable to cases where one cannot reasonably assume
said assertion is true. It is tempting to brush this off as the primitiveness of
the past, a fallacy far too many fall into, to assume humans hadn't a clue what
they were doing until just yesterday. In this case, we can look to Peter
Kropotkin, a man fairly prominent in various circles in his time, who in 1886
wrote[^18]:

[^18]: Peter Kropotkin, "Law and Authority," 1886.

       Peter Kropotkin, "[Law and Authority,][15]" _Kropotkin's Revolutionary
       Pamphlets_, ed. Roger N. Baldwin (Vanguard Press, 1927).

> "_Cleverly assorted scraps of spurious science are inculcated upon the
   children to prove necessity of law; obedience to the law is made a religion;
   moral goodness and the law of the masters are fused into one and the same
   divinity. The historical hero of the schoolroom is the man who obeys the law,
   and defends it against rebels._"

In the words of Murray Bookchin, "[t]he assumption that what currently exists
must necessarily exist is the acid that corrodes all visionary thinking[^17]."

## IV. _The Conclusion_

These terms, psychopathy and sociopathy, originate as _explanations of criminal
behavior_ rather than psychological analysis of observed personality traits, and
so they serve not to describe an individual as one who suffers from a mental
illness but as one who either seems as if or evidently is prone to criminal
acts. By allowing these two ideas, psychology and criminology, to exist
simultaneously in a given term and to use said term widely and offhandedly only
serves to demonize mental illness and to write off transgressions as
psychologically inclined (rather than socially motivated) behavior.

Definitions of psychopathy could more aptly be described as "List of People I
Can't Fucking Stand" by various European proto-fascists than a clinical
diagnosis.

The past is soaked in blood, to simply reach into it and pull a chunk out for
your own purposes will end in nothing but soaking your hands as well.
