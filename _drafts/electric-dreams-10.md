"Your cooking is wonderful as always, dear," I told her.

"Oh, you flatter me," she responded. She could act as humble as she wished, it
would never change the fact that her cooking always brightened up my day. "Just
be sure to eat up, you never know if you're going to have a chance to eat
something before your flight."

"I'm not too worried about that, we can afford to eat on the plane these days,
though nothing they could serve on a plane would ever compare to your cooking.
I certainly need no excuse to eat everything you put before me." I really,
really loved my wife's cooking.

The next day I left before I could grace my taste buds with her food once more,
my flight was much too early to ask that she be awake to prepare a meal.

"I'll be back in a few days, I'll miss you dear," I told her as I opened the
door to leave, suitcase in hand. "Oh, you too Laika," I added in address to the
little dog trying to wrestle her way between me and the door.

**Flight gets delayed**

**Meets fortune teller**

Just down the road from the airport there was a small shop, they sold a sparse
few items as their focus was on fortune telling. I'd heard about it from a
colleague who's spent his share of time waiting for flights here and figured it
was a decent way to kill a few hours.

"Excuse me?" I asked as I pushed the door open, releasing a cloud of dust and a
soul wrenching creak.

**Goes to meeting**

**Falls asleep**

**Wakes up**

**Is sent home**

**Talks to wife**

**Eating dinner**

"The fuck is this!?" I exclaim. Much too loudly, startling both her and the dog.

The food she cooked was so bad not even the dog would eat it, except for her
borscht it was to die for.
