## Preface

A while back I described this idea as something along the lines of a first
person shooter that is also a visual novel about catgirls in an antifascist
militia. I received some questions on that as to how it would actually play
out, and since then I've put some thought into that here and there without ever
really going too in-depth. This is, after all, just a thought I've had floating
around; hell, that concept in and of itself is really just an accumulation of
years of other such thoughts slowly forming into a semi-coherent concept.
Though, the discovery of the game Pathologic has perhaps given me an out there:
it would be kind of like Pathologic. Of course, this might be diminishing the
term "visual novel" a tad, but that was really just in there to get the point
that I want some manner of diverging story lines and player choice involved. I
reference that game specifically here for a few reasons: a) it has shooter
elements but they are largely secondary to the plot, b) it is a story driven
game with dialogue trees and some manner of player choice, c) it is a survival
game that requires one to manage actually being alive, and d) much of the
gameplay exists in such a form that it is inherently punishing to the player.

That last point there is a fairly significant inspiration for this game: I
fucking hate gamers. The constant discourse about how "apolitical" games should
be and the veneration of difficulty make me wish for a game that is so overtly
political in the exact sense that pisses gamers off (always seemingly because
they themselves are staunchly right-wing and only see politics in overt
critiques of their own beliefs or basically any representation of minorities
whatsoever) and so obnoxiously difficult if played as if it
were your average triple A title that even they would have difficulty defending
it on such grounds. To that end, I'm inspired by Receiver in terms of
mechanics, the way it requires you to operate your weapon in its entirety
rather than "press 'X' to reload." This was the initial vector of difficulty,
but survival elements such as those of Pathologic are diagetically reasonable
and extremely savory.

Aesthetically, Battlefield 1 gives off this sense of a difficult world; it
frames this cinematic WWI where you are merely another soldier on the line, but
it loses this in its gameplay like any other shooter where with some practice
you can become something of a god of war, a death machine. The superficial
layer is beautiful, I'd like to take from that, but the mechanics would be
antithetical and are to be strictly avoided. For instance, the ability to
quickly switch between weapons? Absurd! Hell, who can even afford to give every
soldier a side arm? The most efficient way to switch would be to toss one away
and grab another from the hip, but that's a discussion for later and it will
draw a lot from the story as well.
