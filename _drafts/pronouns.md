    How does one talk without pronouns? Are pronouns not a necessary staple of
    language? When broken down to their fundamental function, what even are
    pronouns? Wouldn't, even if such an act were possible, the words become at
    the very least awkward?

## Author's Note

もしもし、海です! A quick endnote here on why this essay was written! Personal
experience here has shown a bit of a distaste for pronouns, honestly. Learning a
bit of Japanese grammar just really cemented the concept of not having pronouns
by default at least. They/them has some charm, being gender neutral and, despite
the backlash of the ahistorical conservatives, working just fine as singular
pronouns, not really anything wrong there. However, not really the ideal style
for Una... everything about "non-binary" or the even more on-the-nose historical
version "genderqueer" comes off as a hint of "other." Fuck "other," why not just
"none?"
