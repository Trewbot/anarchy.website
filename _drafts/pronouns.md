    How does one talk without pronouns? Are pronouns not a necessary staple of
    language? When broken down to their fundamental function, what even are
    pronouns? Wouldn't, even if such an act were possible, the words become at
    the very least awkward?

**Note:** For the sake of consistency, all example sentences will use the same
characters. While the temptation exists to use the generic cast of characters
used in cryptography (Alice, Bob, Eve, etc.), it would be more fun and exemplary
of certain issues with the discussed linguistics to use our own less culturally
cemented characters. To that end, we'll be using a variety of gender neutral
names: Alex, Beau, SaÅ¡a, and Yuki.

These characters will have various genders throughout the implied narrative and
in the end they all live together as a happy little polycule in an anarchist
commune built atop an abandoned industrial town in an undisclosed boreal forest.

## I. Pronouns

First off, it's important that everyone is on the same page regarding the basics
here. So, what exactly is a pronoun?

Simply put, pronouns are words used to replace nouns. In a generic case, the
pronoun is used in a spot one could otherwise have stated a noun. For example,
take the following statement:

>   _Alex doesn't sleep at night, **she** just sits in bed and cries._

Here, "she" is acting in the place of restating "Alex;" alternatively, we could
say:

>   _Alex doesn't sleep at night, **Alex** just sits in bed and cries._

This is equally valid, but has a significantly different tone to it, coming off
as emphatic and mocking.

### I-1. Personal

### I-2. Gender

### I-3. Anaphora

Context, Antecedents, Binding

### I-4. &c.

Demonstrative, Indefinite, Relative

## II. Languages "Without" Pronouns

East Asian languages, mostly.

Some linguists argue that Japanese pronouns are not grammatically pronouns. I
don't remember the source on this, and it's kind of prescriptivist?

### II-X. Topic and Comment

Topic and comment. Topic-prominence. Etc.

## III. Avoiding Pronouns in English

Tip-toeing around using pronouns as much as possible. Like, wording statements
to avoid needing to say a pronoun... this can be kind of dehumanizing,
sometimes.

### III-X. Trivial Solutions

What if just not? Like, always use the full noun?

### III-X. Expletives

Like in "_it_ is raining." Suck my dick, Chomsky.

Dummy pronouns? Do they count?

Existential clauses?

## IV. English Without Pronouns

Trying to make it sound natural. Or just giving up on that and forcing it? We'll
see how it goes, lol.

"He loves her." Like, undefined subjects and objects? Should they just be done
away with? Even tho they're so poetic or whatever?

Talking about the prospect of complete abolition here. Can we just not have any
pronouns in English?

### IV-X. The Pronominal Compromise
