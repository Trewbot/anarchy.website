**Bimodal distribution**; Dimensionality may be an improvement from a simple
binary taxonomy or even a trinary one as seen in a fair few cultures, but it is
nonetheless the reduction of numerous factors into a single higher level factor.
This, of course, may in some cases be useful if there were to be some benefit to
it; however, in this case there are virtually no such benefits of which to
speak. Historically the primary usage was division of labor, which, even if one
disagrees with the rejection of states, one must agree that such a taxonomy is
no longer necessary to achieve the same ends at the risk of stating that ten
thousand years of supposed progress was all for naught.
