    English has many letters that are generally acknowledges as either useless
    or redundant, be it c, x, or q. As it becomes a more globally spoken
    language it also runs into other problems: sounds that are difficult to
    articulate for speakers of other languages, specifically the rhotic.

OwO, what's this? That's right, this entire essay is going to be a roundabout
justification for "owo"ing and "uwu"ing all over the place.

- what is the rhotic

- does everyone have a rhotic? no.

- why do speakers of languages without a rhotic have problems with it?

- how much do these problems extend to speakers of languages with a rhotic?

- what alternatives are there, uwu?
