## History

### Pre-1843 Founding

### 1843-1945

### 1945-1981 Occupation
At the end of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), the
city was rebuilt under the new [Occupational Government](#). The country was
renamed to the [People's Republic of Mun'nena](#) (_ma pi jan anpa Mun'nena_)
and split into 13 [communes](#) (_kulupu_), with Alekala residing in its own
region of [kulupu Alekala](#).

### 1981-2030
After the independence of Mun'nena, a new centralized government was established
as the [Republic of Mun'nena](#) (_ma sama sitelen pi jan Mun'nena_) with the
approval of the [Mun'nena Constitution of 1981](#). The State devolved
significant portions of its power to the kulupu, reestablishing itself as a
[federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation). This process required
each kulupu to establish itself as a federal state and ratify the constitution,
which kulupu Alekala failed to do. In accordance with [Article X](#) of the new
constitution, after kulupu Alekala had failed to establish a federal state
within 18 months the kulupu was classified as an occupied territory by the
Republic. In 1983, as part of the occupation the kulupu and city governments
were merged to form the [Alekala Metropolitan Authority](#) (_ma tomo kulupu
Alekala_). This was done in part to allow for direct rule of Alekala by the
Republic government.
