    "Homura Did Nothing Wrong"

This is my platform and it will be the gallows for all those who believe Madoka
Magica did not need Rebellion Story. 

Madoka is a fucking centrist, a reformist at best.

The incubators continued to seek out more efficient means of exploiting human
emotions (namely suffering) under Madoka's rule, whereas they were fucking
scared of Homura.

Also, like, Homura didn't technically have her wish fulfilled by the Incubators
in the television series, but in Rebellion Story she goes and does it herself
(her wish was to redo her meeting with Madoka with the roles reversed such as
she was the strong and reliable one lending strength to Madoka).
