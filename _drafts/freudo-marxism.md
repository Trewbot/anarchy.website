Aside from Emil Kraepelin, Spitzer was also influenced by Wilhelm Reich[^161]
earlier in his career, particularly from his high school years on as he noted in
an anecdote explaining his initially unpublished paper "An Examination of
Wilhelm Reich's Demonstration of Orgone Energy."[^159] This paper, which was
denied publication in the _American Journal of Psychiatry_ in 1953, attempted to
duplicate the experiments described by Reich for the verification of what he
called "orgone energy," failing to duplicate a small portion due to lack of
available equipment and volunteers, and ultimately concluded that "careful
examination of the data in no way proves or even hints at the existence of
orgone energy."[^160]

        Examination of Demonstrations of Wilhelm Reich's Orgone Energy,'][144]"

        Orgone Energy,'][145]" _The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice_

[^161]: Wilhelm Reich is another character that pops up here and there
        throughout the research for this section; his biography is absolutely
        wild and while it is outside the scope of this work to discuss him any
        further, reading into his life and works is heavily encouraged. It's a
        tipsy turvy tale that includes Freud, Einstein, Marxism, the FBI, the
        FDA, book burning, and dying in jail after being arrested for contempt
        of court.

Spitzer obit.
