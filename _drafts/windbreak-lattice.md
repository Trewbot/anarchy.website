**Ordinary World.**
Recently I've taken to spending a lot of time trawling across [Google Maps][1]
to seek out inspiration. This idea first came to me as something to be done when
building in [Cities: Skylines][2] as described by [YouTubers][3] such as
[Two Dollars Twenty][4] and [Pres][5], the former of whom specifically described
the practice in his [video on creating realistic cities][6]. I expanded on this
usage when, as inspired by [@Send_Lwyds][7]' [thread][8], I began work on a
[world map][9]. The issue with the methods described by many on this topic is
they take a wholly reductionist view on the formation of landmasses. This is
something that I was compelled to iterate on in a tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    things that aren&#39;t erosion that significantly affect landmasses:<br>
    <br>
    1. plate tectonics<br>
    2. volcanic activity (see 1)<br>
    3. glaciers<br>
    4. asteroids<br>
    <br>
    thanks for listening to my ted talk (is this still hip)

The first point here was decently covered by [Artifexian][10] in his [video][11]
on creating fantasy maps, but I wanted something more in-depth. While working on
the [second part][12] of my blog series on worldbuilding, I became particularly
interested in [island arcs][13] which are a result of [plate tectonics][14] that
provide many neat landforms scattered across a world that would allow for a lot
of further worldbuilding. These form along [volcanic arcs][15] where volcanic
activity leads to the creation of [volcanic islands][16] in the form of a, you
guessed it, arc.

**Call to Adventure.**
One such arc of islands
is the [Kuril Islands][17] (RU: Кури́льские острова́, JP: 千島列島 or クリル列島),
which are mostly in Russia (Росси́я) but parts are [claimed][18] by Japan (日本)
as part of the [Nemuro Subprefecture (根室振興局)][19] of the
[Hokkaido (北海道) Prefecture][20]. The exact subprefecture here is important as
it caught my eye when I was scrolling over the Kuril Islands, and by "it" here I
mean this odd sight:
