## I. *The Gender Accelerationist Manifesto*

Honestly, I bought a physical copy of [*The Gender Accelerationist
Manifesto*][1] last year, around the time it became available, but didn't get
around to reading it until earlier this year. My immediate reaction was along
the lines of "a bit too Marxist for my tastes." Sorry, lol. For instance, the
base-superstructure analytical model isn't something that I particularly
disagree with, perhaps it's best to describe my incongruence with it as merely
linguistic. I often use a similar concept in analysis, that of "culture" and
"infrastructure," which are more or less referring to the same ideas but with
different words.
