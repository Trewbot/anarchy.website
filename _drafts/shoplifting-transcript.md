        <td>So over the past few days, over hundreds of tweets and several dozen hours, we've had a lot of discussions about the concept of shoplifting and whether or not it's actually an immoral act... and I mean, we've collated just about every argument against it (just to use the word collated there). So let us go through them one by one and destroy their hopes and dreams.</td>

    <tr>
        <td><b>Chloe</b></td>
        <td>[0:00:45]</td>
        <td>So... there are two main arguments against shoplifting that we've come across, uhh... the first is that it hurts workers and the second is that stealing is wrong. Umm... and... both of those are incorrect arguments and we're going to talk about them so that you know exactly why you're incorrect if you think those things.</td>

		<td><b>Trewbot</b></td>

		<td>Yes, th-that's what we're here to do.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Chloe</b></td>
		<td>[0:01:10]</td>
		<td>So, the first argument, that it hurts workers, if-if this is coming from a genuine place then these people may have some sense of decency, and they may be convinced with, uh, facts and logic as to why they're wrong. But our research does show that most of them aren't actually concerned about that. So... who cares...</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Trewbot</b></td>
		<td>[0:01:34]</td>
		<td>So, companies in general don't actually have any incentive to&mdash;when there's loss to theft&mdash;to actually punish workers for that. If anything it's more financially stable for them to assume, when they're doing their budgeting beforehand that there will be loss, and to view that as an expense; rather than to, as it happens, blmae everyone there and cut their pay. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Chloe</b></td>
		<td>[0:02:04]</td>
		<td>Yeah, and like, part of that is th&mdash; is coming from, like, this sort of mistake that people have about business, where they think businesses are attempting to maximize profit at all times always (which is not true). Businesses don't try to maximize profit they try to meet their target expected profit and being able to consistently meet their goals is far better for their business than just taking whatever opportunity they can to just maximize because those often fail.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Trewbot</b></td>
		<td>[0:02:38]</td>
		<td>Right... a lot of this argument is based on the assumption that businesses don't know how to run a business... and that they're just winging it at every given moment, which may be applicable to some small business but in general it's not like a default mode.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Chloe</b></td>
		<td>[0:02:27]</td>
		<td>On the subject o-of shrink, most, uh, losses that, uhh, that businesses, umm&mdash;in particular stores that are selling things not just any business&mdash;most of, err, the largest percentage of their losses, not most but a plurality of their loss, comes from employee theft not shoplifting. So that alone, like, should clue us in to the fact that employees don't actually care. Umm, it-I believe it's 43% of total losses in retail come from employee theft.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td><b>Trewbot</b></td>
		<td>[0:03:31]</td>
		<td>While doing extremely cursory research on this topic for my excellent article I wrote on my website (anarchy.website, check it out) I-I checked the... the Wikipedia article about retail loss prevention. And then-there's an extremely radicalizing quote&mdash;or at least I think it should be&mdash;with respect to employee theft, and there it says "because associates have access to the entire building and during non-business hours, they're capable of creating s-substantial losses to the company over a longer period of time." So... I mean, and that's backed, obviously, by the numbers you just quoted, but the fact that... employees can and should be doing the majority here, so... individual external theft instances really aren't... statistically the most concerning.</td>

	<tr>
		<td><b>Chloe</b></td>

		<td>Yeah... employees are the ones stealing, uh, most of the stuff and&mdash;</td>
