        <td>So over the past few days, over hundreds of tweets and several dozen hours, we've had a lot of discussions about the concept of shoplifting and whether or not it's actually an immoral act and I mean, we've collated just about every argument against it (just to use the word collated there). So let us... go through them one by one and destroy their hopes and dreams.</td>

    <tr>
        <td><b>Chloe</b></td>
        <td>[0:00:45]</td>
        <td>So... there are two main arguments against shoplifting that we've come across, uhh... the first is that it hurts workers and the second is that stealing is wrong. Umm... and... both of those are incorrect arguments and we're going to talk about them so that you know exactly why you're incorrect if you think those things.</td>

    <tr>
		<td><b>Trewbot</b></td>

		<td>Yes, th-that's what we're here to do.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Chloe</b></td>
		<td>[0:01:10]</td>
		<td>So, the first argument, that it hurts workers, if-if this is coming from a genuine place then these people may have some sense of decency, and they may be convinced with, uh, facts and logic as to why they're wrong. But our research does show that most of them aren't actually concerned about that. So... who cares...</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Trewbot</b></td>
		<td>[0:01:34]</td>
		<td>So, companies in general don't actually have any incentive to&mdash;when there's loss to theft&mdash;to actually punish workers for that. If anything it's more financially stable for them to assume, when they're doing their budgeting beforehand that there will be loss, and to view that as an expense; rather than to, as it happens, blame everyone there and cut their pay. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Chloe</b></td>
		<td>[0:02:04]</td>
		<td>Yeah, and like, part of that is th&mdash; is coming from, like, this sort of mistake that people have about business, where they think businesses are attempting to maximize profit at all times always (which is not true). Businesses don't try to maximize profit they try to meet their target expected profit and being able to consistently meet their goals is far better for their business than just taking whatever opportunity they can to just maximize because those often fail.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Trewbot</b></td>
		<td>[0:02:38]</td>
		<td>Right... a lot of this argument is based on the assumption that businesses don't know how to run a business... and that they're just winging it at every given moment, which may be applicable to some small business but in general it's not like a default mode.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Chloe</b></td>
		<td>[0:02:27]</td>
		<td>On the subject o-of shrink, most, uh, losses that, uhh, that businesses, umm&mdash;in particular stores that are selling things not just any business&mdash;most of, err, the largest percentage of their losses, not most but a plurality of their loss, comes from employee theft not shoplifting. So that alone, like, should clue us in to the fact that employees don't actually care. Umm, it-I believe it's 43% of total losses in retail come from employee theft.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td><b>Trewbot</b></td>
		<td>[0:03:31]</td>
		<td>While doing extremely cursory research on this topic for my excellent article I wrote on my website (anarchy.website, check it out) I-I checked the... the Wikipedia article about retail loss prevention. And then-there's an extremely radicalizing quote&mdash;or at least I think it should be&mdash;with respect to employee theft, and there it says "because associates have access to the entire building and during non-business hours, they're capable of creating s-substantial losses to the company over a longer period of time." So... I mean, and that's backed, obviously, by the numbers you just quoted, but the fact that... employees can and should be doing the majority here, so... individual external theft instances really aren't... statistically the most concerning.</td>

	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td><b>Trewbot</b></td>
		<td>[0:04:42]</td>
		<td>Th-th-the majority of the work should be done by employees, umm... cuz the... they're really the ones with the access to, uh, bulk materials, um... on the topic of that Wikipedia page, there's a... bit that I found, personally, quite hilarious where they say "the vast majority of thieves have one thing in common: they will steal only if they have the opportunity." Which is... funny in that what they intend for it to mean is that thieves are opportunistic, which is, as far as I know, a fairly accurate thing in that most thieves w&mdash; are opportunistic, most people that steal don't intend to steal when they enter the store, but what it's actually saying, if we're to take this sentence on its own, is that people that steal only steal if they have the chance to steal. </td>

		<td>[Chuckles] Yeah, no there's this- there's this wild idea that all shoplifting is teenagers stealing, uh, $1300 handbags and jackets and stuff&mdash;umm, which is also okay&mdash;but, most shoplifting is not that actually. Umm, and this 2005, uh, report from the Food Marketing Institute found that most commonly stolen items from grocery stores were meat, over the counter medicine, baby formula, and, uh, health and beauty products (which can be any range of things). Um, so, y'know, like, i-i-it's not&mdash;</td>

		<td>R-right, I mean, not to immediately declare my power level here or anything, but I have bought an iPhone from a store before and it's difficult even when you're doing it legally. Umm, though I do imagine that, uhh, a lot of... a lot of the red tape involved with the legal process of taking something out of the store is sort of skipped over by shoplifters, but there's a lot to do with, uhh... and this is something that sort of applies to a lot of the arguments like "oh, if-if things are stolen then stores won't stock them"&mdash;there are things that people expect to be stole, like iPhones and deodorant, and what actually happens is they put them in locked cases. And, so... it's difficult to steal them unless you're like really into it, which, I mean, I'm sure there are plenty of people who are...</td>
