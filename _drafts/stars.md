How does one define that moment when yearning is fulfilled? When a longing gaze becomes an embrace? When maybes become truths? Or is it something else entirely? Does it even exist?

Imagine, two strangers. Each burdened by the scars of their past. Each defined more so by their histories than some physical barrier like skin. Each meandering as they do for reasons known only to them as any other that would care to observe their actions and to then posit some explanation thereof had died off so long ago their existence is but a whisper in the sands. Certainly they know nothing of each other, and yet their paths are soon to cross.
