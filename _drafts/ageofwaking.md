To put it simply, we are lost. It doesn't happen often, hell I'd say this is a
first for me, personally. No, I don't particularly think of it as a failure, up
until this point we'd done everything perfectly, at least according to the
theory. Perhaps then one could say that the theory is at fault. After all, if we
implement our ideas to perfection but still are left with an unsatisfactory
result, what can we do but say that the ideas themselves were flawed.

Strategy and tactics are those sorts of skills that I doubt myself in constantly
and in so doing hold myself to the necessary standard to consistently develop my
skills further. Others nearly venerate me when it comes to such matters, but I
could never mirror such blind confidence. However, there's a limit to one's
ability to be presented with their own failures and simply accept them. That
limit ought to have been passed days ago, for one of weaker constitution it may
very well have been weeks ago. It's a miracle we've survived with our sanity
intact. With my sanity intact.

We are lost.

Hopelessly lost.
