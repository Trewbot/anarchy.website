    Debates and arguments are, for some reason, often viewed as a sport with
    clear rules of play. Wherefrom did these rules come? And why are they so
    flexible to the point where flexing them is almost always the winning
    option? Is logic even real?

Argumentation is one of the most absurd arts.
Of course, such a statement coming from me carries little weight as I'm just as
likely to say we should embrace the absurd as I am to say we should cast it off;
in this case I should make it clear that I will be standing by the latter.
Sadly, however, I'm not certain I will be able to sufficiently propose an
alternative, at best I could say to simply avoid the thing entirely.
With that in mind, you should read this as an exploration into the concept of
argumentation and how it holds up from a more metaphysical and perhaps
epistemological viewpoint.
More simply put, you can read this as "Why I Hate Logic."

Let's begin by briefly discussing logic.
We'll be holding off on the "rules for argumentation" sort for now, instead we
will be looking at *mathematical logic*.
Full disclosure, I did fail out of undergrad twice as a mathematics major, but
to be fair it was only my second major so it doesn't entirely count.

Take, for instance, *ad populum* which as a fallacy may assert that a belief
shared by a great number of people is not necessarily a belief that is correct
and so to describe the popularity of a belief is not a valid claim to its
correctness.
In another system, it could instead be said that a majority or even a plurality
of people believing in a common idea validates said idea; this is then a matter
of definition.
Since we could claim that truth is created socially through mass agreement but
choose not to do so, we are here claiming the opposite: an axiom of our logic is
that truth is not derived from popular opinion.
This particular case can be seen as more than a simple declarative rule or even
the codification of an axiom.
