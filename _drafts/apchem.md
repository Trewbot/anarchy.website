    (Spring, 2015) Drugs! Explosions! Cancer due to excessive exposure to
    radiation! Chemistry has it all! I'm not just saying that to posthumously
    justify some bias I have towards chemistry based on the only girl I ever
    convinced myself to love having some interest in biochemistry. Anyway, if
    you want to study the slightly more observable effects of quantum physics
    without ever actually studying what leads to their existence? Then read
    these notes, or something.

So the month is April, date the fourth*. AP Exams are a month away and I signed
up for the chemistry exam without attending the class, therefore I'm taking
notes independently. I don't know how to order these, but I don't think that
matters. I asked how they did it in the class, but perhaps I shall do them
numerically according to the book.

I really don't care that much about chemistry to be honest, like, I like it but
I'm really only doing these notes to flesh out the process for more important
notes, like my calculus or diffeq notes.

## 1 Matter, Measurement, & Problem Solving

### 1.1 Atoms & Molecules

Uhh, <kw>atoms</kw> are things, <kw>molecules</kw> are also things, it's fairly
hype. That's just about the whole section. Maybe I should mark the table of
contents based on whole chapters not each section&hellip; these science
textbooks are so quick to declare new sections while the calc textbook has like
10-page sections.

### 1.2 A Scientific Approach to Knowledge

Minute 14 of caring about chemistry: everything is tedious and fuck science.
The, uh, "observations" lead to making a <kw>hypothesis</kw> and you test this
using <kw>experiments</kw>&hellip; this can eventually lead to creating
a <kw>scientific law</kw>. One or more of hypotheses can form a <kw>theory</kw>
blah blah blah <kw>atomic theory</kw> blah blah they have a chart&hellip;

### 1.3 The Classification of Matter

So, <kw>matter</kw> is anything that occupies space and has mass&hellip; vague
as hell&hellip; a specification of matter is called a <kw>substance</kw>. "We"
classify is based on <kw>state</kw> and <kw>composition</kw>. Anyway, blah blah
blah <kw>solid &rarr; liquid &rarr; gas</kw> (&rarr; plasma, oh right, highs
school). <kw>Crystalline solids</kw> have structures, <kw>amorphous solids</kw>
do not, they also don't have an exact melting point. Gases are free to move
about and are therefore compressible. Here's a chart:

[Insert chart from Page 23]

How to separate mixtures! <kw>Decanting</kw> is a 10/10 procedure, fucking hype!
You carefully pour liquid! Like sand-water, you just pour the water
out! <kw>Distillation</kw>is what you do to appear particularly sciency. You
boil the mixture so the more volatile/easily boiled liquid basically runs the
hell away. If you mix and insoluble solid with a liquid you can
just <kw>filter</kw> it.

### 1.4 Physical & Chemical Changes & Properties

A change in state or appearance without changing composition is called
a <kw>physical change</kw> whereas a change in composition is a <kw>chemical
change</kw>. Same goes for properties: a <kw>physical property</kw> is something
displayed *without* a composition change and a <kw>chemical property</kw> is
displayed *with* ditto.
