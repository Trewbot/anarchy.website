Enjoying your job is a scam. A means by which the system will exploit your
emotions and ultimately suck you dry of them. So, it makes no sense to go for a
job you enjoy just to eventually hate it, go for jobs you're good at; if you're
just going to be miserable at work anyway, might as well make enough money out
of it to enjoy life otherwise.

## Notes

1. "Ulp" is a reading of $\mathrm{U}\ell_{\mathrm{P}}$, an abbreviation
of "udeka-Planck length" where udeka- is the non-standard SI prefix for
10<sup>36</sup> and Planck length is defined as $\sqrt{\hbar
\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{c}^3}$ (about 1.616229 &times; 10<sup>âˆ’35</sup>m) such that
1 Ulp is about 16.2m.
