Enjoying your job is a scam. A means by which the system will exploit your
emotions and ultimately suck you dry of them. So, it makes no sense to go for a
job you enjoy just to eventually hate it, go for jobs you're good at; if you're
just going to be miserable at work anyway, might as well make enough money out
of it to enjoy life otherwise. Of course, you don't *always* get the jobs you're
good at, sometimes you just have to take what's available. I'm not trying to
turn this into a less on economics or job markets, I'm just trying to justify
how I ended up where I am in life. I never had very many friends; family was
never that big in my life either. Point is: this was bound to happen. I was just
destined for some extremely isolated job, I've no attachments and they're
available in abundance.

Yulia is my coworker, she's the one I hang out with when we have to go to the
conventions and quarterly meetings. We don't really have much in common, we were
just hired around the same time and did a lot of the training seminars together.
When I think of her, I see her in these halls, surrounded by why brick,
illuminated in the cool light of the LEDs. It would be hard for me to imagine
her in any other context.

Generally, we're supposed to introduce new ideas slowly. A previous worker was
fired for starting a cult, claiming he was something of a prophet, enlightened
by some god and as such aware of things that could never even be dreamed of by
the likes of the residents of this planet. Perhaps "fired" is too simple a term,
a governing body here had him assassinated and it ruined a few programs he was
meant to be a part of. A lot of the data analysis people really liked him, but
that was just because the amount of information he was sharing was significantly
higher than any of the other workers and the manner in which he was
accomplishing this was unique.

Nonetheless, other departments despised him, HR held the position that he was an
asshole and was using his work to conflate his ego which had the potential to
create issues with other workers. Accounting was less than pleased with his loss
of a body in such a way that it was completely unrecoverable. It wasn't that the
body was too damaged (I'm told it died in a way that was sort of like
asphyxiation, but the details are a bit unclear), there just wasn't any way for
a team to retrieve it as those who assassinated it were working to cover up the
whole ordeal and thus hid it somewhere. Normally, a body would be decommissioned
and brought to a recycling center where it might be altered or scrapped when it
is no longer needed.

It is possible this whole story is just some fable thought up by the research
department to justify to the workers why we have to spend so many years of our
lives disseminating information that to us seems like basic knowledge.

"It's rather hard to burn bridges when you're stranded on an island," I told
them.

"Those outside the self are always, to some extent, foreign to the self, Yulia.
Acknowledging this doesn't make me lonely, but it also doesn't make me happy. I
feel no particular inclination about it at all, actually."

## Notes

1. "Ulp" is a reading of $\text{U}\ell_{\text{P}}$, an abbreviation
of "udeka-Planck length" where udeka- is the non-standard SI prefix for
10<sup>36</sup> and Planck length is defined as $\sqrt{\hbar
\text{G}/\text{c}^3}$ (about 1.616229 &times; 10<sup>âˆ’35</sup>m) such that
1 Ulp is about 16.2m.
