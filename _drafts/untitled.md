Enjoying your job is a scam. A means by which the system will exploit your
emotions and ultimately suck you dry of them. So, it makes no sense to go for a
job you enjoy just to eventually hate it, go for jobs you're good at; if you're
just going to be miserable at work anyway, might as well make enough money out
of it to enjoy life otherwise.
