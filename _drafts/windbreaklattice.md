title: The Windbreak Forest Lattice in Hokkaido
---

So, I was trawling around on [Google Maps][1] as one does, specifically to look
at [island arcs][2] as a quick bit of research for a [recent project][3]. These
are particularly interesting when working on [plate tectonics][4] since they
form along [volcanic arcs][5] as chains of [volcanic islands][6]. One such chain
is the [Kuril Islands][7] (RU: Кури́льские острова́, JP: 千島列島 or クリル列島),
which are mostly in Russia (Росси́я) but parts are [claimed][8] by Japan (日本)
as part of the [Nemuro Subprefecture (根室振興局)][9] of the
[Hokkaido (北海道) Prefecture][10]. The exact subprefecture here is important as
it caught my eye when I was scrolling over the Kuril Islands, and by "it" here I
mean this odd sight:

My immediate reaction was that this looked a bit like how the US (United States
of America) looks on satellite. Take for example this random section of Nebraska

Of course, the US looks like this because of the [Public Land Survey System][11]
which isn't really the only reason land would be formed into a grid. There is
something to be said about the choice of a grid system for agriculture rather
than something like a [ribbon farm][12] system as seen in the New France parts
of the US for [some reason][13], but this isn't exactly informative with regards
to the exact formation seen here. So, I had to go on a little journey, mostly
through Wikipedia because usually you can find at least indicative information
there.

A good entry point, I figured, would be the township this is in. There are three
actually: [Shibetsu][18] ([標津町][19]), [Nakashibetsu][14] ([中標津町][15]), and
[Betsukai][16] ([別海町][17]). Taking a total shot in the dark I guessed door
number three (3) here, but the [English article][16] is all but useless so I had
to go with the very trustworthy method of having Google Translate translate the
[Japanese (日本語) article][17]. This didn't quite yield the results I'd hoped
for, there was an [image of the town from above][20] which I'd hoped would have
some comment about the grids, but it did not (now that I'm compiling everything
I'm noticing that the filename of this image is actually a pretty good
breadcrumb, more on where else it leads later).

Taking a bit of a leap of faith from there, I followed a link to one of the
agricultural coops (農業協同組合) in Betsukai: [道東あさひ農業協同組合][21]; I'm
not going to include the translated name here because I have high doubts that it
is accurate in the slightest. This was also fruitless, so I took a step further
out and went for the page on [dairy (酪農)][22], specifically the section on
[dairy in Japan (日本の酪農)][23]. In that was a subsection called "State-owned
KOSHEN pilot project" (国営根釧（こんせん）パイロット事業), which vaguely indicated
that this was a planned dairy farming project in Hokkaido, a sign of hope here.
There was a reference to [Rojikushima (根釧台地)][24], a page that contained the
phrase "根釧台地の<b>格子状防風林</b>は北海道遺産に認定されている," which was just
about what I was looking for. The translation was basically unintelligible but
still had significant phrases well enough that I could tell it was what I had
been looking for: [grid-like windbreak (格子状防風林)][25].

Of course, now it seems fucking obvious. Had I seen the filename on that aerial
photo I'd probably have seen the "shelterbelt" part and instantly found a whole
bunch of explanatory materials. To be fair, I hadn't really gotten any
sleep at the time, but I was right to draw comparisons to similar structures in
the US. There are [windbreaks][26] all over, named for the fact that they exist
to block out the absolutely terrifying winds you would get if you just had huge
empty fields. _However_, the windbreaks you find just anywhere are typically
only a tree or two wide, whereas the windbreaks in Hokkaido are, according to
[the prefecture's site][25], $180\text{m}$ wide.

Clearly, these are no normal shelterbelts, the [Hokkaido site][25] referred to
them as a heritage site even. I've seen them [mentioned][27] as a tourist spot
as well, which is an interesting occurrence admittedly, so perhaps the site for
the [Nakashibetsu Tourist Association (なかしべつ観光協会)][28] will have
something.
