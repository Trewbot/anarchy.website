Recent developments in neural networks have led to an explosion in the amount of
experiments done in machine learning and the variety of applications of AI that
are being explored. While plenty of new areas are being sought out, old ones are
being solidified and enriched by these newer technologies; one such field of
particular interest is speech synthesis.

Previously, speech synthesis was accomplished through the manipulation of a
collection of voice samples taken from real humans. These samples would be
categorized by the phoneme they represent and some system would convert the
desired text to a list of the phrase's constituent phonemes and simply call the
predefined samples in order (sometimes with some tone and pitch manipulation in
an attempt to make the voice sound more natural).
