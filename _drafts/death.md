title: An Update on Death
---

A few years ago, I wrote two pieces on the concept of death, "[Fear and Death][1]" and "[Death isn't real and neither are you][2]," which were at the time coming from a place of desperately coping with a concept that we, the living, have never been able to fully experience. Of course, I've not since died, and so that fundamental perspective has not changed much. What is different now is that there have been a number of times, perhaps more so than not at this point, where my desire for death has screamed louder than my fear of it.

This isn't all too major of a shift in ideas, but it has brought to my attention what those pieces lacked and what that lacking meant to me. See, being mentally in a place where one perceives death as a way out of problems while simultaneously holding the philosophical position that the universe is itself really a multiverse which we may experience in a number of ways throughout life but in death is functionally deterministic implies that the one solution that was always present will never truly be a solution. To explain further, at a certain point in a life full of constant pain and suffering (be those physics, mental, or social) one begins to only be able to motivate changes by acknowledging that the "worst case scenario" of death is if anything preferable to even the "best case scenario." Then, by taking on a philosophy of death being unattainable until the very last chance of it in any theoretical timeline, this is only a scenario in one specific instance in one timeline where all others of your life will converge when said scenario is upon you. I don't entirely disagree with it at this point, but there is more to death than the conscious experience, and that is what will be discussed here.
