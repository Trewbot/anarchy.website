title: "Goth Angel Sinners Pt. VI: <i>Oscar Wilde</i> + キルラキル Notes"
---

## Introduction

-   Standard opening
    -   U: "Good Sextidi, everyone, and welcome to part six (6) of Goth Angel
        Sinners, a podcast about anarchy, anarchists, and anarchism (and not
        about Lil Peep). I’m Una..."
    -   ~~L: "...I’m Leland..."~~
    -   C: "and I’m Χλόη (Chloe)."
    -   U: "Today we’re talking about Oscar Wilde, one of the few authors from
        the 19th century whose work is palatable enough to actually read."
-   _"I think I may say without vanity - though I do not wish to appear to run
    vanity down - that of all men in England I am the one who requires least
    advertisement [sic]."_ - Oscar Wilde, letter to the Editor of the St.
    James’s Gazette, 25 June, 1890.

## Libertarian Socialism

### "The Case of Warder Martin: Some Cruelties of Prison Life"

-   <http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/prisoner4099/historical-background/transcript-letter.htm>
-   "A resolution of the House of Commons could settle the treatment of children
    in half-an-hour."
    -   No it wouldn’t.
    -   Also, you ever forget that they put children in prison? Like it’s fucked
        up we put any people in prison but there are people who show up to work
        to abuse children like what the fuck. Abolish ICE, btw.

### "The Ballad of Reading Gaol [sic]"

-   <https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Reading_Gaol>
-   It is _not_ Wilde’s fault that it is spelled "gaol" here, just as it is not
    his fault that he was imprisoned there.
-   This poem is fucking depressing. Like, it is mostly flowery words about
    abstractions of the experience, but nonetheless you can feel the dread in
    it. People who support prisons all seem to either be incredibly cruel,
    believe prison to be something of a caricature of its reality, or have
    somehow shut out the truth from their own minds.
-   _"I know not whether Laws be right,<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>Or whether Laws be wrong;"_
    -   This line is clearly some cuck shit, we all know that laws be wrong.
    -   This issue goes back to previous statements of his which seem to imply a
        sort of reformism, and it is questionable if he ever truly reached any
        conclusion against the concept of states as a whole. Of course, the
        concept of a "non-authoritarian" state continuing to exist in ones ideal
        world can be implied by "libertarian socialism" as opposed to
        anarchism."
    -   It is, however, followed by the best couple of lines which are an
        eternal mood (very relatable even for us not yet jailed, read Foucault):
        -   _"All that we know who lie in gaol [sic]<br>
            <span class="tab"></span>Is that the wall is strong;<br>
            And that each day is like a year,<br>
            <span class="tab"></span>A year whose days are long."_
-   _"The vilest deeds like poison weeds<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>Bloom well in prison-air:<br>
    It is only what is good in Man<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>That wastes and withers there:<br>
    Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>And the Warder is Despair."_
-   The ending stanza, which is a repeat of a stanza in the first section, is a
    vague reference to the murder of which the condemned subject of the whole
    poem had committed.
    -   _"And all men kill the thing they love,<br>
        <span class="tab"></span>By all let this be heard,<br>
        Some do it with a bitter look,<br>
        <span class="tab"></span>Some with a flattering word,<br>
        The coward does it with a kiss,<br>
        <span class="tab"></span>The brave man with a sword!"_
    -   This is some yandere shit, in my opinion.
    -   The act is also referred to with much more direct intent in the line:
        "The man had killed the thing he loved, [a]nd so he had to die."
    -   Also apparently this is a Shakespeare reference, specifically The
        Merchant of Venice which contains the line "Do all men kill the things
        they do not love?" Thanks Wikipedia.

### "The Soul of Man Under Socialism"

-   This section is going to include a lot of direct quotation from the text,
    and with that comes the very irritating phrasing Wilde uses of "man" and
    "he" when referring to a person or persons in the hypothetical sense. I
    (Una) don’t mean to entirely use the "a product of his time" defense here,
    but I’m willing to overlook it to an extent based on that. However, realize
    it pisses me and yes I am very tempted to partake in some heavy editorial
    processes with these quotes, but I am restraining myself on that part.
-   Towards the beginning of the work Wilde speaks against altruism as something
    that creates complacency among the impoverished rather that breaking them
    out of poverty. This, of course, could require a bit of contextual
    understanding from the perspective of being in the UK (maybe Leland could
    help with this if he’s here), but in general comes off as something along
    the lines of accelerationism or Bordigism.
    -   Accelerationism here could apply based on the concept of worsening
        material conditions to create a system collapse, tho this is typically
        meant thru inherent flaws of the system building up to lead to a
        completely unsustainable state rather than civil unrest.
    -   Bordigism applies more to civil unrest by way of creating "revolutionary
        potential" (or something along those lines), which would be reduced by
        "reformism" that creates complacency and thus reduces the motivation
        among lower classes to rise up against their oppressors.
    -   In either case, I can’t really agree to this; people are capable of
        understanding that handouts are merely handouts from pity rather than a
        sustainable mode of survival. To argue otherwise is to imply the working
        class or the impoverished are stupid and unable to grasp social
        structures, a typically vanguardist idea.
-   _"Man should not be ready to show that he can live like a badly fed animal.
    He should decline to live like that, and should either steal or go on the
    rates, which is considered by many to be a form of stealing. As for begging,
    it is safer to beg than to take, but it is finer to take than to beg."_
-   _"With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true
    beautiful, healthy Individualism. Nobody will waste his life in accumulating
    things and the symbols for things. One will live. To live is the rarest
    thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all."_
-   Automation
    -   _"Up to the present, man has been, to a certain extent, the slave of
        machinery, and there is something tragic in the fact that as soon as man
        had invented a machine to do his work he began to starve."_
        -   This isn’t an entirely accurate representation, however, see this
            [thread by Dr. Sarah Taber][1] on the time differences between the
            invention of automation in a field and its implementation.
            Specifically, she states that mechanical harvesting ("invented in
            the 1830s") was not brought into Southern farming until after the
            Great Migration as slave labor beforehand was cheaper.
    -   _"All unintellectual labour [sic], all monotonous, dull labour [sic],
        all labour [sic] that deals with dreadful things, and involves
        unpleasant conditions, must be done by machinery."_
        -   While I (Una) tend to praise Wilde for his forward thinking and
            such, what is missed out here is that even intellectual labor can be
            automated, and that there is no real dichotomy between
            monotonous/dull/dangerous labor and intellectual labor.
        -   Another issue is the usage of "must be" here, this would be better
            as "should be" or even more optimally the framing should be that no
            person should be required to do such labor though may very well
            choose to, be it as a hobby or as a sense of fulfillment.
    -   _"At present machinery competes with man. Under proper conditions
        machinery will serve man."_
-   Anti-work (slightly retaining the context of automation here)
    -   _"The fact is, that civilization requires slaves. The Greeks were quite
        right there. Unless there are slaves to do the ugly, horrible,
        uninteresting work, culture and contemplation become almost impossible.
        Human slavery is wrong, insecure and demoralizing. On mechanical
        slavery, on the slavery of the machine, the future of the world depends.
        And when scientific men are no longer called upon to go down to the
        depressing East-End and distribute bad cocoa and worse blankets to
        starving people, they will have delightful leisure in which to devise
        wonderful and marvellous things for their own joy and the joy of
        everyone else."_
        -   While this quote is potent and eloquent, it is not without issues.
            First being the use of the term "slaves" here, which I (Una) agree
            to an extent that this can diminish the historical discussion of
            slavery as a mode of production.
        -   Second, I (Una, again) firmly believe that people can do more than
            one thing, and while coerced labor (as I’m more inclined to call it)
            is demoralizing as such, it does not make culture and contemplation
            "almost impossible." I would more likely describe this phenomenon as
            the framing of such things become seeped in a class divide, where
            the employers define for themselves what such things look like and
            view that of the employed as mere reflections.
        -   We could also humor transhumanist arguments to the end of what does
            "mechanical slavery" entail? If we were to view machinery as an
            extension of a society which itself is an extension of the ecology
            of the world does this not then qualify as the subjugation of a
            synthetic nature? Obviously there are lines that must be drawn here,
            but it’s difficult to say with confidence where exactly.
    -   _"...the community by means of organization of machinery will supply the
        useful things, and that the beautiful things will be made by the
        individual. This is not merely necessary, but it is the only possible
        way by which we can get either the one or the other."_
        -   This is a pretty brief/concise description of the core concept of
            libertarian socialism.
        -   The idea that "it is the only possible way" may have many arguments
            against it, however, it can be read as stemming from Wilde’s
            perspective on "beautiful things," namely art, which will be
            discussed at length later on.
    -   _"A work of art is the unique result of a unique temperament. Its beauty
        comes from the fact that the author is what he is. It has nothing to do
        with the fact that other people want what they want."_
        -   **This essay does not end on this concept, but I would like to put
            it towards the end as it provides a better transition towards _The
            Picture of Dorian Gray_ and Wilde’s other works pertaining to the
            philosophy of art. (I haven’t finished reading the essay tho so
            we’ll see).**

## _The Picture of Dorian Gray_

### "In Defense of Dorian Gray"

-   Most of the points in the letters that comprise "In Defense of Dorian Gray,"
    as the collection is dubbed, reiterate to some extent a point brought up in
    the book itself: art is wholly separate from, though influenced by, reality.
    -   Specifically, the idea of moral judgement is brought up in the first
        letter (25 June, 1890) with the line _"I must admit that, either from
        temperament or from taste, or from both, I am quite incapable of
        understanding how any work of art can be criticized from a moral
        standpoint."_
-   Wilde fucking bodies the paper he is writing to with the lines _"To say that
    such a book as mine should be ‘chucked into the fire’ is silly. That is what
    one does with newspapers."_
-   _"He opened his article by a gross personal attack on myself. This, I need
    hardly, was an absolutely unpardonable error of critical taste."_
