I will not thank any of those with power who gave me what little aid they willed
when they could have done for me so much more yet chose not to. Be it by nature,
habit, ignorance (either circumstantial or deliberate), or simply because they
were not intending on sharing that power with others, I will not thank them for
what little they did when they could have done more. I will validate their
putting forth the bare minimum, the expected, amount of aid to a friend, a
student, a relative, an employee. It was I that plunged into the void and
emerged victorious, their existence may have been necessary but they played
their roles and nothing more.
