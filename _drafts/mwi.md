Today, the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics reigns supreme amongst
educators and physicists of all breeds. It is mathematically proven and requires
little philosophical thought to accept beyond the notion that certain aspects of
our reality are simply unknowable. This sort of idea is heavily rooted in
interpreting quantum mechanics through the lens of classical mechanics, one of a
few reasons why it is so often used to describe quantum mechanics to students
who had only previously been exposed to classical mechanics. There are, of
course, alternative interpretations that take on different philosophical
approaches. Pilot Wave Theory is one such interpretation which leans more toward
the classical mechanics side with its view of wave-particle duality as a system
of pilot waves guiding the particles to their ultimate locations. An
interpretation that moves farther away from classical mechanics than the
Copenhagen (while still holding some fairly classical views) is the Many-Worlds
Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (MWI).

While often treated as a multiverse theory, the MWI does not assert the
existence of parallel universes but of other worlds that exist within our own
singular universe. This distinction may not be all that significant, but it may
be helpful to keep this in mind when exploring the ideas of the interpretation
nonetheless. One such idea is the scope of a world, which in the MWI does not
necessarily encompass all objects in the universe. While all objects must be in
some world, if the objects within one world do not affect any objects that are
not in that world then these other objects can be said to be in a separate
world. This idea is more a philosophy of a hypothetical than it is an
interpretation of our current understanding of the laws of physics since they
describe forces that have an infinite, though with greatly diminished strength,
range.

The perception of worlds as contents of rather than equivalent to the universe
may also aid in the understanding of what an object experiences as time
progresses according to the MWI.

**FIGURE 1.** The observer defined here as you has a singular past and a
singular present. As time goes on and worlds split, this you will go on to
become a new you in each of the newly formed worlds, each of which will have a
singular past you which is the current present you. You will not become any
single one of these future yous; because each shares the present you as their
past you, the present you will simultaneously become all of these future yous.

The universe as described by the MWI is deterministic, which can be interpreted
as an indication that free will is not real in such a universe<sup>2</sup>, but
perhaps this
is not such a simple leap. While it is true that, based on the existence of a
world for any given possible outcome of every single quantum system within the
containing universe, the state of the universe at any time in the future can be
described mathematically based on its current state, this does not necessarily
mean that a conscious observer within a singular world will experience a
predetermined life. This point can be further clarified by examining the
method by which a description of the universe would be created in this case. As
with several other parts of the MWI, this description is based on classical
perception (though not technically reliant on a distinct definition of
this<sup>1</sup>). A world is first described as the product of the states of
all objects within the world, |Ψ<sub>object</sub>⟩, and particles or other
such factors that do not fit into any object definitions, |Φ⟩, such that

<center><p>|Ψ<sub>World</sub>⟩ = |Ψ<sub>Object 1</sub>⟩ |Ψ<sub>Object 2</sub>⟩
|Ψ<sub>Object 3</sub>⟩ ... |Ψ<sub>Object N</sub>⟩ |Φ⟩.</p></center>

Based on this depiction and the idea that the universe is a container for all
worlds branching from its conception, the state of the universe is the described
as<sup>3</sup>

<center><p>|Ψ<sub>Universe</sub>⟩ = |Ψ<sub>World 1</sub>⟩ |Ψ<sub>World 2</sub>⟩
|Ψ<sub>World 3</sub>⟩ ... |Ψ<sub>World N</sub>⟩.</p></center>

## Endnotes:

1. While this definition uses classically defined "objects" in its
representation of a world, the distinction of what is an is not an object is
handled by the extra factor that exists to handle the existence of factors that
contribute to the state of the world that would not be described as members of
any object.

3. It is often stated that there are infinitely many worlds and thus
the last term in this description (|Ψ<sub>World N</sub>⟩) would be unnecessary;
however, given that the current understanding of quantum mechanics is that many
systems have a discrete set of outcomes and values such as time, distance, and
energy are described as integer values of some minimum, the amount of worlds
splitting from any given system will merely be large and not infinite. The
constant splitting of many worlds into many more worlds may approach infinity
but under the assumption that the universe itself is not infinitely large nor
eternally old, this amount is not truly be infinite.
