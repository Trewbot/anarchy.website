title: An Introduction to the Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics
tags: philosophy metaphysics quantum-mechanics article
---

Today, the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics reigns supreme amongst
educators and physicists of all breeds. It is mathematically proven and requires
little philosophical thought to accept beyond the notion that certain aspects of
our reality are simply unknowable. This sort of idea is heavily rooted in
interpreting quantum mechanics through the lens of classical mechanics, one of a
few reasons why it is so often used to describe quantum mechanics to students
who had only previously been exposed to classical mechanics. There are, of
course, alternative interpretations that take on different philosophical
approaches. Pilot Wave Theory is one such interpretation which leans more toward
the classical mechanics side with its view of wave-particle duality as a system
of pilot waves guiding the particles to their ultimate locations. An
interpretation that moves farther away from classical mechanics than the
Copenhagen (while still holding some fairly classical views) is the Many-Worlds
Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (MWI).

While often treated as a multiverse theory, the MWI does not assert the
existence of parallel universe, but of other worlds that exist within out own
universe.
