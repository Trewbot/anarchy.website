title: All Cops Are Bastards
---

All cops are bastards. Yes, all cops. I state this as neither an anecdotal
impulse nor a statistical generalization; it is a fundamental critique of the
very structure that is not only the modern but also any given historical and
even theoretical conception of law enforcement.

The simplest argument, the one in my experience most commonly lined up for its
brevity and thus utility in the ever present [Twitter][3] discourse[^2], is that
cops serve to enforce law, regardless of the content of law, and so in the case
where there exists even a single unjust law they are sworn to uphold it. This,
of course, simply states that cops are the apparatus thru which the unjust whims
of legislature take physical form. Perhaps Mike Isaacson ([@VulgarEconomics][1])
stated it best with "There is no law; there is only enforcement."[^1] A law is
a mere concept, liberally it's a directive, a statement of intent by the
serving lawmakers be they elected or appointed thru some archaic hereditary
ritual. In turn this concept becomes a reality by means of its enforcement, be
it passive as a bureaucratic measure or active as is implemented by law
enforcement. One could then further argue that they also become a sort of deeper
concept with cultural adoption, people may choose to live by the guidelines
handed down to them just as the bureaucrat, but do you, dear reader, know the
entirety of the law which hangs over you? Have you not once hesitated before an
act to consider "is this legal?"

[^2]:   I'm using this as an introductory explanation as I believe it is both
        precise and allows for a degree of further explanation. As for the real
        regularity of it, I honestly can't say; personally, as an anarchist, I
        tend towards circles of those with similar inclinations, it would
        require some analysis for me to be able to describe what arguments a
        Marxist-Leninist might employ to condemn police within a capitalist
        state but not within their so-called socialist predecessors' states
        aside from a distinction between the proclaimed aims of the laws which
        they enforce.

[^1]:   Mike Isaacson ([@VulgarEconomics][1]), "There is no law; there is only
        enforcement," Twitter, [Sep. 19, 2017][2].

Moving on, by no means assuming that the reader is wholeheartedly convinced of
the frivolity of laws by that mere few statements, to the idea of enforcement.

Returning to the previously shelved topic of laws.
-   Consent of the governed.
-   Consent _to be_ governed.
    -   Human nature? The inherent desire to be ruled? Anthropology!
-   At best choice of by whom to be governed.
    -   Freedom of movement to select a state?
    -   Democracy?
