Illusion of Choice:
- You are constantly presented with many minor decisions to distract you from the few choices that truly matter.
    - What do you want for lunch?
    - Which shirt should you where today?
- The choices you make are dictated by false dichotomies, often making you choose between two options only to have the same outcome (or a similar outcome) regardless of your decision.
    - The two-party system.
    - Competing brands owned by the same company.
- By making these decisions you believe that you have control in a world where your life is all but predetermined by the powers that be.
    - The actual psychological phenomenon of "illusion of choice."
- Consistent perpetuation of the illusions of choice creates a culture wherein such illusions are expected if not viewed as optimal.
