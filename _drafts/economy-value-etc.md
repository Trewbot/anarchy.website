Capitalism perpetuates itself through institutions of government and
economy, but faults in these systems could lead to its collapse. However, it
is not without countermeasures to such failures.

## Marxian and Neoclassical Economics

**This section can basically just be a brief overview of neoclassical economics
and its ideas on commodification.**
Commodification, the shift in social perception and treatment of any resources,
products, people, ideas, et cetera so as to be sold in a
market[^7]<sup>,</sup>[^8]<sup>,</sup>[^14], is fundamentally anchored to
the idea of attribution of value.
In modern society, we have come to view mathematics as the basis for our
understanding of the world.
This is true in not only physics, but economics and even sociology as a
whole[^12]<sup>,</sup>[^13].
If we were to simply trade one item for another, it is arguable that the two
parties doing said trading are agreeing on some value for each item in the
trade.
The value doesn't have to necessarily be given a number, just Person A views
Item 1 to have the same value as Person B views Item 2 to
have[^1].

[^7]:  *Commodify*, Merriam-Webster.

[^8]:  *Commodity*, Merriam-Webster.

[^14]: Marxists, *Commodification*.

[^12]: *Game Theory*, Wikipedia.

[^13]: Don Ross, *Game Theory*, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2016.

[^1]:  Theoretically, if trades were made in such a system between three parties
       (Persons A, B, and C), where Person A trades Item 1 for Person B's Item
       2, Person B trades Person A's original Item 1 for Person C's Item 3, and
       finally Person A requests a trade to take back their Item 1 from Person
       C, Person C could deny said trade on account of them valuing Item 1
       higher than Item 2 (which Person A now has). That is to say that the
       transitive property does not necessarily apply in this system, as each
       trade is itself a new context in which each item is valued by the parties
       that hold and request them. The change in value can be attributed to
       change in circumstance, Person C may inherently value anything that they
       received from Person B as a higher value than anything they received from
       Person A by default. It could also be that over the time between trades
       Person C found Item 1 very useful and therefore now attributes higher
       value to it. If the circumstances are changed slightly such that it is
       Person C who is attempting to trade Item 1 back to Person A for Item 2,
       in such a case the argument could be made that Person A, having been
       willing to trade away Item 1 to begin with, has no interest in once again
       having Item 1.

**Maybe not make this about math culture?**
Nonetheless, any person raised in a world that values mathematics as a necessary
interpretation of all of reality will almost certainly attempt in some regard to
define some mediating value in the aforementioned exchange.

This may not necessarily be a negative trait; however, it is severely flawed in
the assumption that it is the item itself that is given value by the two parties
and not the exchange from the reference frame of each individual party.
In a market, it is the item being exchanged that is given some value, as it is
not being exchanged for property of another party (thus making the exchange
reliant on the value said party attributes to the property), but currency whose
value is defined by some greater collective and infrastructure.
This is, at its core, a compromise of the value the seller attributes to the
item and the social institution of value that the market upholds; whereas, in a
trade of property between two parties, each party is working to find a palatable
medium of the value they attribute to their property and that which the other
party attributes by way of exchanging it for property of the party that both
parties hold equal value to from their respective perspectives.

The buyer in a market is not putting up their property to be traded with your
property, at least not in the immediate sense, and so there is no matching of
attributed value.
Primarily, the value for which an item is sold in a market is based on
prediction, or "speculation," in this specific instance[^2]
the seller must predict what price the sellers of items for which they would be
otherwise willing to trade for the item offered by this seller would sell their
items for in this same market.
Of course, historically one could easily make the argument that this is all mere
pragmatism, must the dairy farmer go each to the general store owner, the
cobbler, the blacksmith, et cetera and bargain with each, offering up milk that
could otherwise be sold for a shared currency that could then be used to buy
items from each of the aforementioned sellers?
No, especially not in the modern system of international markets, but still this
system of commodification has many undesirable side effects that must be
explored and countered.

[^2]: Speculation is also the source of value in other instances within a market
      system, such as stocks being bought and sold based on the assumed or
      predicted value of the company backing them.

## Capital Culture

The extent of the problem with commodification cannot be grasped with the
examples put forth above, such examples are built on the assumption of property,
autonomy, control, access, ownership, and, to an extent, the universality of
people's ability to compromise on value[^3].

[^3]:  \ **Give references/discussion about how humans may not always agree on
       value.**

While commodification is in part derived from the perception of all things based
on some numerical value, this is still an abstract idea which is only reified
when a legal structure enforces property rights such that these values may be
held by individuals or other entities[^15].

[^15]: Anthony Bonen and Jose Coronado, "Delineating the Process of Fictive
       Commodiﬁcation in Advanced Capitalism", 2015.

**Explain each step of commodification, each level or whatevs.**

**Give examples at each phase.**

## Work

To discuss work, one must be certain of that which is being discussed, giving a
working definition[^9] so as to avoid any confusion.
Here, Black's definition[^4] as clarified by
Ross[^5] is used: work is forced labor.
This is clearly a very vague definition, but it must be so out of necessity as
many definitions that aim to be more specific inevitably cut out major sectors
of what should be considered work, e.g. domestic labor.

[^9]: Pun not intended, but duly acknowledged.

[^4]: Bob Black, *The Abolition of Work*, 2009.

[^5]: Chloe Ross, *Different Types of Activity*, 2017.

Not working is incompatible with our current situation: a society built upon
labor[^4].
This idea was more harshly stated by Wilde[^10]:

[^10]: Oscar Wilde, *The Soul of Man Under Socialism*, 1891.

><a name="wilde"></a>The fact is, that civilisation requires slaves. The Greeks
were quite right there. Unless there are slaves to do the ugly, horrible,
uninteresting work, culture and contemplation become almost impossible. Human
slavery is wrong, insecure, and demoralising. On mechanical slavery, on the
slavery of the machine, the future of the world depends.

Not only does Wilde imply here that civilization as it stands is built on
oppression and exploitation, but he also asserts that a solution to this
predicament would be automation.
At risk of being totally tangential, the idea of automation is worthy of further
discussion.

Even within [Wilde's statement](#wilde) there exists an indication that
automation will not necessarily end work.
He claims that civilization requires it, that is to say that civilization is
built upon it, and so replacing work done by people with work done by machines
does not imply at all that work will be completely overhauled by the
introduction of the machine; rather, it asserts that automation is the direction
in which we must push so as to eventually abolish work.

**About what not working is like:**
Consequence must still exist without work, simply replacing it with play would
not suffice[^6].
Play is not necessarily non-productive and so the dichotomy of work and play is
not completely polarized[^5].

[^6]: William Gillis, *Stress, Labor & Play*, 2010.

## Aesthetics

To simply assert æsthetics[^14] as the means by which to
counter commodification would be an essentially meaningless statement.
As aesthetics is that which has no bearing on anything other than itself, the
aforementioned statement would mean nothing more than "just stop being
commodified."
Shaviro more precisely describes aesthetics as "the one thing that cannot be
reduced to political economy"[^11].

[^14]: This is an archaic spelling of "aesthetics" using the now defunct English
       letter æsh. I may be shooting myself in the foot here by using this as
       some text-to-speech programs may not be fully equipped to handle this as
       well as some crawlers and text searches, but this was always meant to be
       the extremely convoluted and esoteric version of this essay that will
       eventually be cut down and polished into a more condensed form so I'll
       let myself have this one.

[^11]: Steven Shaviro, *Accelerationist Aesthetics: Necessary Inefficiency in
       Times of Real Subsumption*, e-flux Journal, 2013.

**How do we move from our current state to one of pure aesthetic indulgence?**

**Something about prefigurativism.**

**Some other shit probably about full automation.**
