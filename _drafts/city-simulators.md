title: The Treachery of City Simulators
---

- anecdote about how im a fucking nerd that grew up playing simcity 2000

- examples of issues in city sims

  - cops do not function as enforcers of the state

  - approximation of democracy as demand meters

  - show how some manage to handle said issues

- restrictions on how realistic they can be

  - in theory there can be no perfect simulation of a universe within
    itself, but we aren't concerned with such accuracy

  - even given a reasonable standard of realism as to how a city operates,
    a video game probably wouldn't be able to effectively meet it (such as
    the aforementioned approximation of democracy)

  - we can argue that they are, as video games, asserting an alternative
    reality rather than mirroring our own to perfection

- we shouldn't try to make sims more realistic, rather more absurd

  - instead of having approximations of things like police just do away
    with them completely as they are functionally just a single form of
    infrastructure that the game requires you to handle

  - many people play city sims to create what is essentially a diorama of
    a place they would like to live, why not focus on this and create a
    set of rules that would create more comfortable cities by default?

  - this is the part where i talk about the kind of thing i want to see in
    such a game

    - big fuckin steampunk legs on houses so like when people move in they
      bring theyre houses with them

    - catboys, catgirls, and nyanbinary residents

    - gotta be able to chill, hang out at the park, smoke some weed, maybe
      hang out on the swing set or something
