title: The Treachery of City Simulators
---

- examples of issues in city sims

  - cops do not function as enforcers of the state

  - approximation of democracy as demand meters

  - show how some manage to handle said issues

- restrictions on how realistic they can be

- we shouldn't try to make sims more realistic, rather more absurd
