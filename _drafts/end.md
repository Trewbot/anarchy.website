No trumpets herald the end, no bells toll for the death of the world. No horsemen ride in the quiet of the night to decide its date. And no one will mourn over the corpse when it's gone.

Where are the gods now? Hiding in their shame for failing to drive the plot? Cowards, the lot of them, fucking cowards. Chaos is the only deity present, and chaos cares not to judge, it damns us all. If we are to be forsaken as such, is this not already hell? Reigned only by a devil of our own creation, one who designs no clever machinations of torture but simply lets consequence bare its fangs against our actions. Truly, we reap what we sow, a collective punishment for merely forgetting to rip out each other's throats for each's own sin.

The seas boil because they are hot, thunder rings across the sky because lighting strikes, fire spreads from sparks. For action, so reaction.
