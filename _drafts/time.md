title: Time is not so forgiving
---

I never imagined this would be the one, this dreadful place. So gray, so very
gray. Almost as if the world had neglected color here so it could concentrate on
more important things. Can it be forgiven for having accomplished so much
elsewhere or am I simply turning a blind eye to imperfection after finding what
I was looking for?

"What're you staring at?" he asks.

"That tree," I point out into the forest at a leafless tree, an object so
colorless it makes the surrounding plant life look almost colorful.

"I see," he pauses to consider this for a moment. "Why?"

"I like to take notes of these issues, in case I ever get the chance to go in
and fix them."

"Why would you want to fix a place that is already perfect?" He's complacent in
this place; perhaps it's because he was born here. Nothing about it seems to
bother him and every time I mention something I find wrong about it he attempts
to pull some romantic line out of it. I hate to say it but he might just be what
I've been looking for this whole time.
