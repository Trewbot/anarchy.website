title: Something about isekai (and also John Brown).

I imagine with reasonable certainty that the reader would agree were I to say
that _Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari_ (盾の勇者の成り上がり) is, from a writing and
production standpoint, a superior show to _Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai
Kyousoukyoku_ (デスマーチからはじまる異世界狂想曲).[^1] However, I'm not
particularly interested in the ease with which the content of a show can be
consumed, at least not for the purposes of this article, but before getting into
the contrasts of the two works I should first explain some commonalities. The
trivial fact that they are both isekai anime aside, both series' protagonists,
_Tate no Yuusha_'s titular "Shield Hero" [Iwatani Naofumi (岩谷 尚文)][4] and
_Death March_'s [Suzuki Ichirou (鈴木 一郎)][5], own slaves. In fact, they both
ironically use this slave ownership to show that the character is a good person
through their treatment of slaves that would otherwise be treated horribly.
While there are some reasonable arguments for this method of characterization in
the universe of the media, the implications of it should not be overlooked.

[^1]:   At the time of writing this, _Tate no Yuusha_ has a score of [8.50][1]
        and _Death March_ has a score of [6.87][2] on [MyAnimeList][3]; my
        ratings for the shows are 6 and 4 respectively.

_Tate no Yuusha_ suffers from a multitude of issues beyond the slave ownership
that are themselves facets of the context in which it comes to be. The story
begins with Naofumi being transported from his world (presumably the same world
as the audience) to another world with game-like mechanics for those who are
transported there (called "Heroes" of which there are four). There is a clear
distaste for Naofumi in this world, he assumes at first based on conversations
held with the other heroes this is due to his lack of knowledge of MMO mechanics
as compared to the others who are each well versed in them, but this
misconception is rectified later with the realization that the heroes can only
wield the legendary weapons they are assigned such that the "Shield Hero" can
carry no weapons other than a shield. As the heroes are summoned to save the
world from impending doom, the lack of offensive capability leaves the one
assigned to the role of Shield Hero as what could be considered a waste of the
effort put in to the summoning of them, thus the hatred towards Ichirou. Within
this context each hero is given a party with whom they are to adventure so as to
train for the predicted waves of monsters that would attack the kingdom in which
they were summoned; the party is assigned based on the will of those the kingdom
had gathered, and thus Naofumi is left alone. The now infamous among fans [Malty
Melromarc (マルティ＝メルロマルク)][6] uses this opportunity to pretend to ally
herself with Naofumi, ultimately betraying him by falsely accusing him of sexual
assault.

Fiction (and to a lesser extent non-fiction) quite beneficially allows us to
explore ideas we are unlikely to experience in our own lives, be it simply to
enjoy a new perspective or to open up discussion to often overlooked concepts.
Of course, the presentation of certain ideas is not without consequence, for
instance the statistically uncommon act of falsely accusing someone of rape is a
very common idea asserted to detract from conversations on the handling of
legitimate accusations. That is not to say that the topic is disallowed in any
way from media, rather that the handling and timing is of utmost importance.
Consider what is inferred by the later revealed fact that Malty is the daughter
of the king that had ordered the summoning of the heroes: a woman of high social
status uses her position to destroy the reputation of the protagonist (portrayed
as a "nice guy" thru the narration and his actions) to gain favor with another
hero who would also subsequently gain the favor of the king. It's incel-y as
fuck is what I'm saying.
