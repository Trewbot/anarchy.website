I imagine with reasonable certainty that the reader would agree were I to say
that Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari (盾の勇者の成り上がり) is, from a writing and
production standpoint, a superior show to Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai
Kyousoukyoku (デスマーチからはじまる異世界狂想曲). However, I'm not particularly
interested in the ease with which the content of a show can be consumed, at
least not for the purposes of this article.
