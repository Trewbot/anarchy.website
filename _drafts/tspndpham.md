Disclaimer: I have never and likely will never have sex, I say this based on my
own intentions to never have sex as I have no desire to participate in such
acts. Of course, given that I am writing this work, I am nonetheless interested
in the topic and have done thorough research on the theories and practices
pertaining to it. That is to say that I cannot backup anything contained in this
work based on my lived experience, which is something that can also be said by
most about the majority of the content here past the initial setup of the sex
position space as we all exist in 3-dimensional space.

## Defining a Sex Position Space in 3-Dimensions

In order to be able to extrapolate from the sex positions developed in three
dimensional space, we first need to define a system of mathematically describing
these positions. Additionally, such a system would benefit from being
independent of the number of beings involved. For simplification, "beings" here
will refer to humanoids, such that the amount of theorizing with respect to the
physical form of these beings required to properly describe their arrangement in
the position is minimized.

What then describes a sex position? Possible elements here are: relative
position of each being, relative orientation of each being, interlocked limbs,
and interacting genitalia and orifices. Defining relative position and
orientation required defining a coordinate system; this is often created in such
a way that some primary element is at the origin without any rotation with
respect to the coordinate system's axes, here that primary element will be the
humanoid who is in the most stable and unchanging position and orientation. This
can be manifested.
