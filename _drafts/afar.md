## Introduction

We need to talk about gender. Specifically, we need to talk about the portrayal
of gender in so-called "gender bending" stories. This is a broad category, which
is in part due to the nature of categorization and how it forces one to simplify
the themes and ideas of a work down into easily indexed labels. To that end, a
clarification is needed: we will be discussing works whose overall themes are
those that pertain to gender identity and expression for the most part, with a
few here and there that only deal with said ideas passingly or in small sections
compared to the length of the work overall. A fitting format for this discussion
is a bit hard to pin down; as a bit of a compromise that deals with the variety
of the content here, the format here will be short reviews with a focus on
gender, each categorized by common genres, with each category being its own
section that is introduced with a discussion on the general ideas thereof.

The reviews will be a bit more meta than typical reviews, including tangents
into the language used, the translations, the production, and the reception of
various communities. It is necessary to point out that fiction may be a window
into another world, but it does not exist outside of context. Whether it is an
anime, a manga, or a novel, everything is both created and consumed by people in
the real world. Ideas have effects, people's perception of the world around them
and how they interact with it can be changed by the media with which they
engage.

Of course, media can affect people more than just making them think or feel, and
so a few warnings are in order.

First, the representation here will be a bit unbalanced, with a noticeable bias
towards characters assigned male at birth (AMAB). This is due to general social
perception, available media, as well as a bit of the author's own bias here. I,
<ruby><rtc>ウナ</rtc><rbc>海</rbc></ruby> (Una), would like to extend my
apologies to any non-AMAB readers for this. Some care was taken to ensure there
was as much balance as was viable in writing this, but the contrast still
stands.

Next, we will be talking about hentai, pornographic content. A good portion of
the audience is probably already aware of this, but the treatment of gender
non-conformity and such in porn is quite different than in other media; in some
ways the former acts as a more extreme version of the latter and it others it is
entirely different. There won't be any images or embeds for these words, so do
feel free to read this in public. Since this is split into distinct sections for
each work discussed, any section specifically about adult content will be
conveniently marked with "<sup>18+</sup>" in the title, same for any links to
age restricted sites.

Similarly, there are some other things that aren't necessarily "adult content"
that will be denoted at the beginning of the relevant section. These include but
are not limited to sexual assault, abuse, and various bigotries.

Finally, as language is an important part of this discussion, a good amount of
slurs will be brought up in both Japanese and English. These slurs are not
censored here for the sake of clarity and discussion.

[^33]

## I. ネカマ/ネナベ (Gaming)

The content of this first section is fairly basic in terms of gender identity
issues, but the linguistics are pretty complicated, so it's worth having an
entire dedicated section. The titular terms themselves are relatively simple,
「ネカマ」(_nekama_) is a man who plays as a woman in an online game
and「ネナベ」(_nenabe_) is a woman who plays as a man.「ネカマ」and「ネナベ」are
derived from「オカマ」(_okama_) and「オナベ」(_onabe_) respectively; the _o-_
prefix is replaced with _ne-_ due to the manner of derivation. To show _nekama_
specifically, the original term「オカマ」is prefixed with「ネット」(_netto_) in
reference to "internet" or "net" in gaming, and the full term「ネットオカマ」is
then cut down to「ネカマ」for convenience.[^15]

[^15]:  "[ネカマ][21]," _Wikipedia_, Retrieved Jan. 5, 2020.

The etymology doesn't stop there, however, as we need to discuss what the the
originating terms, _okama_ and _onabe_, mean.「<ruby><rtc><rt>お</rt>
<rt>かま</rt></rtc><rbc><rb>御</rb><rb>釜</rb></rbc></ruby>」(_okama_) is the
polite form of「釜」(_kama_), meaning "pot" or "kettle," it can also be written
as「お釜」in a more modern style.[^12] _Okama_ is also <ruby><rtc><rt>えど</rt>
<rt>じだい</rt></rtc><rbc><rb>江戸</rb><rb>時代</rb></rbc></ruby> (_edo jidai_,
Edo Period) slang for "anus,"[^13] this meaning possibly being derived from "an
analogy comparing a man's butt to the shape of certain pots."[^14] From this
came the expression「お<ruby><rtc><rt>かま</rt><rt></rt><rt>ほ</rt></rtc><rbc>
<rb>釜</rb><rb>を</rb><rb>掘</rb></rbc></ruby>る」(_okama o horu_), which could
be roughly translated as "to plough" in the sense that it refers both to the
performance of anal sex and to one car rear-ending another.[^16]

[^12]:  "[御釜][18]," _jisho_, Retrieved Jan. 5, 2020.

[^14]:  "[お釜][20]," _Wiktionary_, Retrieved Jan. 5, 2020.

[^16]:  "[お釜を掘る][22]," _jisho_, Retrieved Jan. 5, 2020.

This is likely the most straightforward theory of the terms origin and also
lends itself to the theory for _onabe_: keeping in theme of the「釜」for
men,「<ruby><rtc>なべ</rtc><rbc>鍋</rbc></ruby>」(_nabe_), referring to a sauce
pan or another pot,[^17] was used. The specific choice of _nabe_ over other
similar words was probably influenced by the term「<ruby><rtc><rt>なべ</rt>
<rt>かま</rt></rtc><rbc><rb>鍋</rb><rb>釜</rb></rbc></ruby>」(_nabe kama_),
meaning "pots and pans,"[^18] a general term for kitchenware.

[^17]:  "[鍋][23]," _jisho_, Retrieved Jan. 5, 2020.

[^18]:  "[鍋釜][24]," _jisho_, Retrieved Jan. 5, 2020.

Another, more convoluted, "theory"[^45] of the term's origin starts with the
word「<ruby><rtc>きく</rtc><rbc>菊</rbc></ruby>」(_kiku_), "chrysanthemum,"
which euphemistically refers to the anus.[^19] From the Edo Period, this was
made even more indirect by morphing into「かけ<ruby><rtc>ま</rtc>
<rbc>間</rbc></ruby>」(_kakema_); the「間」refers to a space, specifically that
between「か」and「け」when the kana are listed out: <b>か</b> き く <b>け</b>
こ.[^23] This would be written「<ruby><rtc>かけま</rtc>
<rbc>陰間</rbc></ruby>」which supposedly caused slight confusion as the first
_kanji_ is usually read「かげ」(_kage_) and so「<ruby><rtc>かげま</rtc>
<rbc>陰間</rbc></ruby>」(_kagema_) came to refer to a "homosexual prostitute
who [sells] favors at banquets."[^21][^22] From there the rest of the evolution
is fairly vaguely the addition of the _o-_ prefix and the morphing then
from「おかけま」(_okakema_) to「おかま」as we know it now.[^20] Or so that theory
goes.

[^45]:  This is honestly more likely a joke, not totally implausible but given
        how much more believable other theories are it's pretty safe to just
        disregard this. (I kept it in because I don't feel like cleaning up the
        footnotes.)

[^21]:  "[陰間][27]," _jisho_, Retrieved Jan. 5, 2020.

[^22]:  Fun fact, 陰間 (_yīnjiān_), simplified as 阴间, is a Chinese term for
        "afterworld" as in heaven or hell.

    "[陰間][28]," _Wiktionary_, Retrieved Jan. 5, 2020.

[^20]:  "[オカマ][26]," ニコニコ大百科, Retrieved Jan. 5, 2020.

Assuming we were to believe the 陰間→オカマ evolution, then a more likely
etymology would start with「<ruby><rtc>かぶき</rtc>
<rbc>歌舞伎</rbc></ruby>」(_kabuki_), a "classical Japanese dance-drama."[^24]
Throughout its history, Kabuki performers were often available for prostitution,
essentially making the「<ruby><rtc>ちゃや</rtc><rbc>茶屋</rbc></ruby>」(_chaya_)
that hosted the performances into condensed cultural centers that provided
plays, prostitutes, meals, and social gatherings. Notably, until 1629 when they
were banned for being "too erotic," women played all roles in kabuki; banning
women specifically from performance was, of course, a confusing move since the
themes of kabuki were themselves rather suggestive. After the banning of women,
the roles of women were played by young men called「<ruby><rtc>わかしゅかぶき
</rtc><rbc>若衆歌舞伎</rbc></ruby>」(_wakashu kabuki_), since men in adolescence
can more easily act femininely. These boys, ranging from 12 to 18 years of age,
were also prostituted, and so the practice was eventually banned as well. From
here, however, we find the term「<ruby><rtc><rt>かげ</rt><rt></rt><rt>ま</rt>
</rtc><rbc><rb>陰</rb><rb>の</rb><rb>間</rb></rbc></ruby>」(_kage no ma_) in
reference to those who were in training and not yet on stage;[^25]「間」roughly
translates to "within" in this context[^26] and「陰」to "shadows,"[^27] i.e.
"in the shadows" or "behind the scenes," you get it. This then morphed
into「陰間」by dropping the「の」particle.[^28]

Now that we have a _vague_ idea where the word _okama_ comes from, what does it
actually mean in the modern world?

Broadly speaking, _okama_ is a derogatory term for feminine gay men.[^46] It
wouldn't be a stretch to call it a slur, akin to "faggot,"[^47] and we'll see it
treated as such in works like _FukaBoku_. This comparison is particularly apt as
the term is reclaimed in the same sense, people who would be derisively called
by it may use the term to describe themselves without the same connotation. It
does generally hold the implication of referring to feminine gay men or trans
women (as per its derivation), though as with any word this is not exclusive
and may also be a self descriptor or slur against masculine gay men as well.

[^46]:  "[おかま][44]," _Wikipedia_, Retrieved Jan. 13, 2020.

[^47]:  Brad Stephenson, "[Japanese Words That English Speakers Get Wrong][45],"
        _liveaboutdotcom_, Aug. 2, 2018.

Anyone who is familiar with discourse surrounding slur reclamation would likely
expect this from the previous paragraph, but there have been critics using
_okama_ to refer to oneself. The main argument being its deprecating nature; to
some, reclamation of slurs is a sign of liberation, take that which was used
against you into your own hands or such, while to others its seen as resignation
to your own discrimination. In either case it would be agreed that a third party
using the term is derogatory.

Keeping all this in mind, when the term is used to describe a character, it's
likely referring to the stereotype of effeminate or flamboyant gay men. In this
case we could translate it more closely to "sissy" in English. The exact
characteristics of this stereotype are, of course, slightly different than we
would expect in western media. To defer to the tumblr blog satans-tiddies:[^48]

[^48]:  "[BL, "Okama", and gay stereotypes in animanga][46]," _satans-tiddies_,
        May 30, 2018.

>   "Japanese media has an _okama_ character archetype, which reflects how
    society thinks a gay man looks and acts. You may be surprised to hear that
    it’s not the willowy, androgynous _bishounen_ of shoujo manga. [...]
    The _onee/okama_ stereotype is, essentially, trying to emulate femininity
    but with a painfully and exaggeratedly masculine body. It is flamboyant,
    disruptive, “weird”, and stands out, traits considered negative in general
    Japanese society."

The "exaggeratedly masculine body" here typically shows up as tall and muscular,
the characters will usually have short haircuts and a stubble, accentuating a
contrast between the feminine aspects of blush, painted lips, and a variety of
mannerisms. This has obvious homophobic and some transphobic overtones, and it
is rather surprising how often this simply goes over the heads of viewers.

To give a few examples of this characterization for reference:

-   ガーフィール (Garfiel), the automail mechanic from『鋼の錬金術師 FULLMETAL
    ALCHEMIST』(Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood).

-   <ruby><rtc><rt>ほもおだ</rt><rt>ほもお</rt></rtc><rbc><rb>保毛尾田</rb>
    <rb>保毛男</rb></rbc></ruby> (Homooda Homoo) from the popular variety show
    『とんねるずのみなさんのおかげです。』(Thanks to Tunnels).[^49] This
    example is from the 1980s, but the character was brought back for the
    show's 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary special in 2017; this revival was met
    with significant backlash from LGBT support groups.[^50]

## II. 異性装 (Crossdressing)

Moving on to crossdressing, <ruby><rtc>いせいそう</rtc><rbc>異性装</rbc></ruby>
(_iseisou_), as we'll sort of work our way from breaking gender norms to
breaking gender.[^2] This should be fairly clear, but clothes do not a gender
make. Here we'll be talking only about works in which the main character
crossdresses, namely where the character starts doing so within the story and
is more or less not feminine beforehand. This is a pretty fuzzy definition, but
we need some baseline to distinguish 女装 (_josou_) from オカマ (_okama_).

[^2]:   It's a silly joke but let me have it, please. おねがい!

The term「異性装」(_iseisou_) refers to crossdressing in general, a somewhat
literal translation would be "other gender clothing." The「異」(_i_) here is
easiest read as "other" in this context, but is more literally "difference" or
"odd;"[^5] this is the same as in「<ruby><rtc>いせかい</rtc><rbc>異世界</rbc>
</ruby>」(_isekai_).「性」(_sei_) is, annoyingly, used in compounds for both
"sex" and "gender," e.g. 「<ruby><rtc>むせい</rtc><rbc>無性</rbc>
</ruby>」(_musei_) can mean "asexual" as in no sexual attraction, "sexless" as
in not having any sexual characteristics, or "agender" as in not having any
gender.[^7][^6] Finally,「装」(_sou_) just means "clothing," there is no
explicit definition of wearing said clothing but it is contextually implied.

[^5]:   "[異][13]," _jisho_, Retrieved Jan. 1, 2020.

[^7]:   "[性][14]," _jisho_, Retrieved Jan. 1, 2020.

[^6]:   This is particularly aggravating to me, the author, as I wholeheartedly
        identify as "agender," but my relationship with the term "asexual" is
        not as firm. If I could outright say "yes, I am asexual," the multiple
        meanings of this term would be something of a convenience, but since I
        cannot I stick to simply saying「Xジェンダー」in Japanese.

Usually the more specific terms「<ruby><rtc>じょそう</rtc><rbc>女装</rbc>
</ruby>」(_josou_) and「<ruby><rtc>だんそう</rtc><rbc>男装</rbc>
</ruby>」(_dansou_) are used, the former for men dressing as women and the
latter as women dressing as men.

One of the more prevalent setups for _josou_ is "I have to crossdress for family
reasons." Such reasons will include tradition or succession, often with the
condition that the character in question is not found out to be crossdressing
for a given period of time. Due to the common setting for anime and manga being
high school, this period would most likely be the duration of their schooling
(three years in Japan).

Of course, there's also the usage of _josou_ as a bit. Characters that don't
normally crossdress doing so for something like their class running a
crossdressing café during a school festival. This is frequently pushed forward
by the class imagining a particularly feminine boy in their class in a maid
uniform or something along those lines. This sort of thing really isn't our
focus per se, but it's important enough to discuss one or two examples.

Starting off with a series that doesn't entirely fit the category, but does
include a trope or two worth mentioning here as well as some other relevant

</ruby>』(_Assassination Classroom_) is a generally lighthearted
series despite consistently touching on topics such as assassination (as per
the title), social stratification, and emotional abuse. While there is
definitely much to say on the former two topics, the lattermost is what's
relevant to this discussion as a whole.

While the story follows the entirety of 3年E組 (Class 3 E) and their teacher
<ruby><rtc>ころ</rtc><rbc>殺</rbc></ruby>せんせー (Koro-*sensei*, from 殺せない

        some effort into double (well more like nine or ten times) checking that
        the pronunciation matched and that what I'd written down made sense.

Supposedly, they just found the clothes abandoned by the pool, and they just so
happen to fit Nagisa.

They completely abandon this premise the moment Nagisa is invited to a drink.

[^51]:  Some of these lines were well past my ability to parse out by
        listening, and trying to search by reversing the translation and typing
        similar sounding phrases into Jisho and Google Translate didn't work at
        all. BUT, as it turns out this conversation is ripped directly from the
        manga.

    I'll spare you any attempts at adding the manga translation into this
    table; as consolation here it is:

    |**Karma**    |Nagisa-kun,
    |             |if you want to get rid of it,<br/>the earlier the better.
    |             |(Something about hormones.)
    |**Nagisa**   |I'm not getting rid of it!!<br/>I'm keeping it!!
    |**Karasuma** |Can you guys save that for later?
    |**Nagisa**   |...<br/>I'm never doing that again.

    The last line's translation here definitely made more sense in the subs,
    though it isn't impossible to consider that Nagisa was referring to the act
    of crossdressing with「二度としません」(_nidoto shimasen_), the context of
    the conversation does point more towards it being a reply to Karasuma.

</ruby>』(_Absolute Obedience Game_) is a regrettably short (four

and growing to show reluctance when finally given an out.

</ruby>』(_Secret Princess_) is another manga that employs the student
council's orders model, though from a slightly different direction. The
titular-ish <ruby><rtc>ありかわ</rtc><rbc>有川</rbc></ruby>ひめ (Arikawa Hime)
is plagued by debt piled up by his parents in his name and the debt collectors
it comes with before being relieved of this stress by the student council that
pays it all off on the condition that he crossdress for the duration of high
school. The title is a pun on「<ruby><rtc><rt>ひ</rt><rt></rt><rt>ごと</rt>
</rtc><rbc><rb>秘</rb><rb>め</rb><rb>事</rb></rbc></ruby>」(_himegoto_,
"secret") and the name Hime; the English translation of the title furthers this
by including "princess," which is one way to read「ひめ」(<ruby><rtc>ひめ</rtc>
<rbc>姫</rbc></ruby>).

In contrast to Hime's backstory, his younger sibling, <ruby><rtc>ありかわ</rtc>
<rbc>有川</rbc></ruby>かぐや (Arikawa Kaguya), willingly dresses as a girl and
has done so for a few years prior to the events of the manga. The two's stories
are also differentiated by social perception: while Hime is, to his own
surprise, rather well accepted by his classmates, Kaguya was met with bullying
and scorn. Sadly, this is likely a more realistic story in that sense.

Backing up a bit, when Kaguya first transfers in to a new elementary school (in
5th grade to be precise) they're seen as a girl; while immediately popular as
any cute transfer student would be, they pushes others away since as they say:

||日本語|English|
|---|---|---|
**かぐや** (Kaguya)|本当のかぐやを知ったら<br/>みんな離れて行くから|Everyone will stay away from me once they find out who I really am,

{: .pullquote .pullquote_image .pullquote_left}

While the class rep to whom Kaguya said this, <ruby><rtc>いちごう</rtc>
<rbc>一郷</rbc></ruby>いちご (Ichigou Ichigo), believed that they were simply
being dramatic and introverted for no reason, this prophecy came true. The class
soon found out Kaguya was "biologically male," and their opinions immediately
shifted to that of disgust. Then came the bullying, and despite it all Kaguya
stayed firm in their choices. This is perhaps the most important part of the
whole story of Kaguya's past: where other characters in Himegoto would take any
excuse to stop wearing girls' clothes (at least initially), Kaguya refuses to
stop even when demanded to both explicitly and implicitly through the opinions
of others.

...

Regarding pronouns, Kaguya doesn't use first personal pronouns, instead using
their name in self reference. This isn't necessarily gendered, but is considered
cute and childish, thus usually used by young women and younger children.[^39]
Of course, there are a few exceptions, but they don't detract from the general
argument. They use「<ruby><rtc>じぶん</rtc><rbc>自分</rbc></ruby>」(_jibun_) for
"myself" and at one point during their backstory use「うち」(_uchi_):

Disappointingly, however, in this context _uchi_ is not the pronoun "I," a usage
originating in「<ruby><rtc>かんさいべん</rtc><rbc>関西弁</rbc>
</ruby>」(_kansai-ben_, Kansai Dialect) and growing in popularity with women
elsewhere for the past few decades.[^35] In this case _uchi_ is either being
used in the sense of "(one's) family/household"[^36] or "we/our."[^37]

English pronouns are much more difficult here, as English is very gendered in
that sense. Thus far we've used "they/them" for Kaguya, this is mainly due to a
lack of any definitive statement on Kaguya's gender. One could argue they are a
guy, using "he/him" pronouns, that is just really dedicated to the bit, or that
they still identify as a boy regardless of their speech patterns, clothing, and
so on. These are valid interpretations, but so then would be arguing that
Kaguya is a trans girl, using "she/her" pronouns. For that reason, neutral
pronouns have been used. For completeness sake, the only self description with
regards to gender that we get out of Kaguya is the following passage from
Chapter 2:

||日本語[^41]|English[^40]|
|---|---|---|
|**ひめ** (Hime)|かぐやは男ってこと<br/>隠してるんだっけ？|Aren't you hiding that<br/>you're a boy, Kaguya?

This could be read as nothing more than a joke, given the tone and context, but
it is also a valid identity; gender is, after all, personal and however one is
comfortable defining themselves is how they are then defined. As for what this
specifically means, we'll discuss that in detail in the next section ([3.

In the second chapter of the Comic REX serialization, one panel makes reference
to a particular meme that's worth discussing here:

The meme, which according to _niconicopedia_ originated on Twitter,[^31] is
meant to mock the obsessiveness of many「ボーイズラブ」(_bouizu rabu_, "boys'

(_yaoi_) fans, specifically fangirls termed「<ruby><rtc>ふじょし</rtc>

_fujoshi_ itself was initially also meant as an insult, a pun on「<ruby>

but has since been reclaimed.[^32]

## III. 男の娘 (Femboy)

Let's just get this out of the way, "trap" is a slur. The
term「<ruby><rtc>おとこのこ</rtc><rbc>男の娘</rbc></ruby>」(_otokonoko_) is
sometimes translated as "trap," but in more recent times it's more common to
use "femboy" or "tomgirl" (see [Pixiv][1] and [nhentai][2]<sup>18+</sup>).
There are, of course, many instances of the term「トラップ」(_torappu_), which
is a transliteration of "trap." In these cases the fault for using the term
would almost definitely fall on the author; this is most evident in _hentai_,
and is further worsened by a typical association of the term being mostly used
for underaged characters.

This association also falls on _otokonoko_ as the term is a play on the
term「<ruby><rtc>おとこのこ</rtc><rbc>男の子</rbc></ruby>」(_otokonoko_) which
means "boy," with the distinct connotation of being a child (...の子). As it
is a homonym, sometimes「男の娘」will be read as "_otokonomusume_," but the
reading as _otokonoko_ is more or less the "proper" reading.「娘」(_musume_)
generally　means "daughter" but is also used as a term for young girls in
general and is also read as "_ko_." For instance, in「<ruby><rtc>ぼくっこ</rtc>
<rbc>ボクっ娘</rbc></ruby>」(_bokukko_) and「<ruby><rtc>めがねっこ</rtc>
<rbc>眼鏡っ娘</rbc></ruby>」(_meganekko_).[^1]

[^1]:   "[otokonoko 男の娘][3]," _Japanese with Anime_, Feb. 2, 2018.

And so returning to the problem of "trap." The previous paragraph cites,
[_Japanese with Anime_][4], a site that has been particularly useful for its
[list of terms][5] relevant to this topic. However, the particular article
[attempts to address][6] the offensiveness of the term and frankly falls short.

>   Personally, although I agree that calling a transgender person a "trap" is
    normally offensive and you shouldn't do that, I don't think there's any
    problem with calling _otokonoko_ **characters** "traps." There's a clear
    distinction between reality and fiction here: fiction is made up by
    somebody: the author.[^1]

Personally, Fuck. You. Any media analysis that posits a dichotomy between a work
of fiction and the reality in which it exists is undeniably apologia for a
culture that refuses to check itself. They go on to say people don't associate
quote unquote traps in anime with transgender people in the real world, that the
two concepts are separate and that the idea doesn't even occur to the authors in
question. This is all common points made in defense of the use of the term, and
at this point all we can ask is that if you agree with this, learn to read the
room a little. With the gay (or trans) panic defense still being a valid legal
defense in most of the States and trans women continually being treated as men
trying to "infiltrate women's spaces," the least you can do is stop using a term
that implies a person is being feminine to trick others.

There will be no apology for making this lecture, this sort of problem is more
or less the motivation for this work. Hate crimes aren't funny.

"Are traps gay?" This is not a real question. The above article again makes what
could almost be considered progressive arguments for weebs on this topic,
pointing out that in the real world this is a matter of the persons own
identity (there are a select few who identify as a trap, along the lines of slur
reclamation). However, they again fall into the mindset of considering fiction
to be wholly separate from reality, stating that they are not _by default_.[^3]

[^3]:   This whole section's a bit of a mess. They essentially argue that unless
        a character openly states they are gay or is shown in a gay relationship
        (totally ignoring the existence of bi- and pansexuality), then they are
        _not_ gay. This is then doubled down on by claiming that relationships
        are rare in anime and manga, and thus this can be stated as a general
        rule... with the exception of やおい (_yaoi_), a genre literally defined
        by the inclusion of relationships between men. Frankly this is cherry
        picking.

This also somehow ignores that when someone asks "are traps gay" they are not
asking "is someone who identifies as a trap gay" they are asking "is it gay to
be attracted to traps" in most cases. The answer is that there are no special
rules to sexuality when fiction is involved, if we truly want a definitive
answer we could say that if you identify as a man and the character in question
identifies as a man then that is homosexual attraction; appearance does not
define gender. But this is in itself imposing rules, in actuality so long as
both parties involved consent to the relationship being called "gay" then so it
is. Of course, many times when this is all brought up, the consideration is less
"is it" and more "would it be perceived as" and this further complicates the
question in that different people see things differently, one must assert their
own identity. If you are attracted to a man who appears feminine and you
yourself are a man, saying that your attraction is not gay could very well be
you denying someone else's identity out of your own insecurity.

Again, it's not a real question. If you don't know someone else's sexuality then
you don't know, and that's fine. If you're trying to broadly categorize because
you're insecure about your heterosexuality then please don't project this onto
others.

</ruby>』(_The Secret Devil-chan_) exemplifies many of the issues with trends
in _otokonoko_ works and even of the term "trap" to an extent. It starts out
with our protagonist, <ruby><rtc><rt>くろさき</rt><rt>そう</rt></rtc><rbc>
<rb>黒﨑</rb><rb>総</rb></rbc></ruby> (Kurosaki Sou), summoning a devil to take
away his virginity supposedly on account of his playboy childhood friend,
<ruby><rtc><rt>はいだ</rt><rt>かずし</rt></rtc><rbc><rb>灰田</rb><rb>一志</rb>
</rbc></ruby> (Haida Kazushi),
cockblocking him his entire life. Excited that the summoning worked, Sou jumps
right into things only to discover that the devil he summoned, <ruby><rtc>
<rt>でいもん</rt><rt>こぐれ</rt></rtc><rbc><rb>泥門</rb><rb>小紅</rb></rbc>
</ruby> (Deimon Kogure), is "male." Evidently, in his mind the inclusion of a
dick completely outweighs the cuteness and willingness of Kogure, which is
understandably confusing for a succubus brought to Earth for the sole purpose
of having sex.

From Kogure's perspective, this whole scenario is nonsensical both from, as they
proclaim near the end of the series, having never been rejected before and from
the reason for this rejection. They essentially state that human gender norms
shouldn't be applied to devils, which would make sense as gender, being
cultural, isn't even a universally consistent construct across humanity. Sou,
however, completely rejects this disconnect and attempts to enforce an wholly
reductionist idea of gender:

||日本語|English[^8]|
|---|---|---|
|**小紅** (Kogure)|⋯あの～|...Uh...
||なにをそんなに<br/>嘆いてるの？|You don't have to<br/>cry that hard...
||ボクは悪魔だから<br/>男とか女とか人間が<br/>決めたカテゴリには<br/>属さないよ？|I'm a devil,<br/>whether I'm a boy or a girl<br/>isn't something you humans<br/>can categorize.

{: .dialogue}

[^8]:   ゑむ, "ひみつの悪魔ちゃん," わぁい! 1 (Apr. 24, 2010), trans. Soba-Scans.

In Soba-Scans' translation, Kogure is usually referred to as "she," even in
declarations like "but she's a boy!" However, as the above interaction is by far
the most honest descriptor Kogure gives of their self throughout the series,
gender neutral pronouns and terminology will be used here. This neutrality seems
to generally be overlooked, but it is refreshing to see instances where all
references to a character aren't translated to masculine pronouns when it is
stated they have a dick.

The [TV Tropes page][15] for the manga also mentions this, referring to the
gender construct point, including this listing:

>   [Blue and Orange Morality][16]: Since demons do not categorize gender the
    way humans do, Kogure is just unable to understand why Sou doesn't want to
    have sex with him after the ["reveal"][17].

Reading through the article for "blue and orange morality" in the context is
rather baffling to say the least. It boils down to a set of morals that is too
alien for humans to comprehend, which is often a difficult trope to pull off in
fiction because the author is human. But what's so alien about rejecting the
standard gender binary? In the opinion of the author here: fucking _nothing_.

As far as gendering language goes in the untranslated manga, Kogure uses the
fairly masculine「ボク」(_boku_) as a first person pronoun. This isn't unheard
of for girls, though; in fact, Sou initially assumes that Kogure is a
ボクっ<ruby><rtc>こ</rtc><rbc>娘</rbc></ruby> (_bokukko_), pretty much just a
girl that uses _boku_:

||日本語|English|
|---|---|---|
|**総** (Sou)|しかもボクっ子なんて<br/>最高！|And she refers to herself as a boy!<br/>She's the best!
{: .dialogue}

Others typically refer to Kogure as「小紅ちゃん」(Kogure-*chan*), which is quite
familiar and feminine; use of the given name is in itself familiar, and the
*-chan* honorific is also familiar as well as generally associated with
adolescent girls. In the first few chapters, Sou would start out with calling
them「悪魔さん」(_akuma-san_), along the lines of "Ms. Devil," then
dropping the honorific to a simply「悪魔」(_akuma_). From the beginning of
chapter 4 onward, he would call them「小紅」without any honorifics, though his
actual use of the name is rare and most his references to Kogure are inferred.

Incidentally, Sou uses「<ruby><rtc>おれ</rtc><rbc>俺</rbc></ruby>/オレ」(_ore_)
as a first person pronoun. Kogure refers to him as「マスター」(Master) in private
and「総クン」(Sou-*kun*) in public.

Focusing more on Sou then. Seemingly, Sou is the only person who is bothered by
Kogure's sex traits, and this forms the basis of the overall plot and conflict
in the series. When Kogure shows up at Sou's school, the whole class views them
as a cute girl; when Kogure falls down and the whole class get an upskirt view
(exacerbated by Kogure's initial aversion to underwear) this hardly changes.

Despite gaining the admiration of just about every boy they meet, Kogure remains
fixated on Sou, constantly making sexual advances and suggestive remarks. At
first, this is clearly due to the contract between the two of them, but over
time becomes love, and in either case is outright rejected on the flimsy basis
of gender.

Rejection hurts Kogure both emotionally and physically, they are a succubus
after all. They survive off of the bodily fluids of humans, and again due to
Sou's reluctance must usually steal a kiss or lick an open wound to get any. On
occasion Sou would cave but nine times out of ten Kogure has to take the
initiative.

### III-6. FEMBOY FRIEND<sup>18+</sup>

## IV. 性転換【第１部】転生 (Reincarnation)

We've now reached the origin of the joke in the title "Assigned Female at
Rebirth," which also happens to have been the inspiration for this work as a
whole. Consider the following hypothetical scenario: you were Assigned Male at
Birth (AMAB) and throughout your whole life never felt any particular discomfort
with the social gender that came along with this designation. You lived one life
that may have been filled with conflict and suffering, but nonetheless your
gender never added to these problems; that is, until you were suddenly killed by
a truck speeding down the road you were crossing too fast to stop before hitting
you. Upon this death you meet some deity, let's say a goddess to keep in theme
with the common tropes, who, despite any potential complaints coming from you,
sends you on to your next life to be born a girl. Are you, with the soul of a
man, comfortable with this situation?

The answer would likely be "no." You are, after all, now a man living in a
woman's body. Not entirely dissimilar to the experience of trans men, but with
the added clarity that you have lived many years as your preferred gender such
that the self-doubt many trans folks are plagues with does not exist for you. Of
course, it isn't impossible for you to be fine with this, certainly for many sex
and gender don't matter.

In some cases, you may even prefer this situation, despite no previous
discomfort. It wouldn't be too farfetched to say that you never even considered
the possibility of being another gender and now, having experienced it, find
yourself more comfortable than before. The experience is personal, there is no
right way to go about it. Acceptance or opposition are both equally valid here,
regardless of the logic behind the conclusion.

We'll be exploring works that fall under each of these cases in this section,
and some that don't quite fit as well.

Then, to explain the title of this section as well. First off, the term「<ruby>
<rtc>せいてんかん</rtc><rbc>性転換</rbc></ruby>」(_seitenkan_, sex change) is
rather broad when it comes to media. To that end, we'll be applying to term to
both this section and the next (thus the roman numerals). The division here is
kind of arbitrary, this section will loosely cover the <ruby><rtc>いせかい</rtc>
<rbc>異世界</rbc></ruby> (_isekai_, other world) genre, wherein characters are
reincarnated into another world. More generally, this will cover stories where
the character's gender changes upon reincarnation,「<ruby><rtc>てんせい</rtc>
<rbc>転生</rbc></ruby>」(_tensei_). The next section will be cases where the
character isn't reincarnated, but still has their sex changed (we're still going
to distinguish this from situations wherein the character willingly seeks out
the sex change).

On the term _seitenkan_.

### IV-1. 幼女戦記

『<ruby>
    <rtc><rt>ようじょ</rt><rt>せんき</rt></rtc>
    <rbc><rb>幼女</rb><rb>戦記</rb></rbc>
    <rtc><rt>youjo</rt><rt>senki</rt></rtc>
</ruby>』(_Saga of Tanya the Evil_[^52]) is a
series that doesn't focus too much on the gender aspects. There are essentially
just justifications for the setting and character design in that regard, but the
driving ideas of the story center more around critiques of human resources and
nationalism. So, again, we'll just be picking at the parts that matter here and
more or less ignoring the rest.

[^52]:  This translation is... odd. It's used as a subtitle in the anime and as
        the title for the Yen Press translation of the light novels. A more
        literal translation would be something like "young girl war records;"
        either way it's better to just stick to the Japanese title.

A Japanese salaryman is murdered by a man he had fired.

||日本語[^54]|English|

|サラリーマン[^53]<br/>(_Narrating_)|男だ。性本能は、生物学的に組み込まれている。自分を自分で、設計したならばともかく、私達を設計したのは自分自身ではないはずだ。|But I am biologically male. Certain sexual instincts are programmed into me. I can't do anything about those. It'd be another story if I had handled the programming, but I didn't.

|⋮|⋮|⋮
||ならば、その状況にぶち込めば、貴様でも、信仰心に目覚めるのだな？|So if I remedied that, even the likes of you would awaken to faith?
{: .dialogue}

[^54]:  The Japanese lines for this were taken from the web novel not the light
        novel, there may be some slight deviations because of this.

[^53]:  Tanya's past incarnation is never given a name, so I'm just using the
        filler「サラリーマン」(_sarariiman_, "salaryman") in place of a name.

fairly typical _isekai_ setup where the main character, <ruby><rtc>
<rt>ほうらい</rt><rt>りいち</rt></rtc><rbc><rb>蓬莱</rb><rb>利一</rb>
</rbc></ruby> (Hourai Riichi), is ran over and sent to the afterlife. The
essence of this story is that the "goddess" here is, as is logical for this sort
of setting, a service worker.

As is to be expected, the first chapter gives the exposition through the
interaction between Riichi and this "goddess," explaining what his new life will
be like and why.

## V. 性転換【第２部】〇〇体化 (Transformation)

### V-1. けんぷファー

I'm going to start this one off in first person, because the only reason it's
really included at all is fairly personal. Generally, most works in this article
have been either recent or had a significant cultural impact, this one doesn't
really fit into either camp there.『<ruby>
    <rtc>&nbsp;</rtc>
    <rbc>けんぷファー</rbc>
    <rtc>kenpufaa</rtc>
</ruby>』(_Kämpfer_) was something I was into some time in high school, before
I was really aware of my own gender identity (or lack thereof); it's not
particularly profound in that regard, but it's part of the fact that I was
perhaps more interested in gender-bending anime than a cis person might be. In
short, this is pretty much just me being nostalgic. Along those same lines, a
fun note here is that this was actually my first "magical girl" show, I never
saw Sailor Moon on TV like many weebs of this generation, lol.

...

The comments fill me with such an intense hatred for people that it's honestly
hard to discuss at all, let alone as impersonally as the majority of this work
has been. What happens is fucked up, yes, is it forgiven by parties involved
though? Yes. Does that make it any less reprehensible? Not necessarily. However,
how often when something happens to a girl in a manga do you see the audience
yell about how the perpetrator deserves to be "tortured to death"? I've seen
people claim a woman deserved to be abused for breaking a promise she made when
she was ten-years-old, weebs don't give a fuck about women, so what's different
here? Why did I feel when reading these comments before I even read the material
that something more was going on here?

He's gay.

Hell, the entire conflict is because he's gay. He's struggled because of this,
he pushed Hina away because he knew he was just using her to be able to be
himself at her expense.

We're finally going to talk about『<ruby>
    <rtc><rt>ふかかい</rt></rtc>
    <rbc><rb>不可解</rb><rb>な</rb><rb>ぼく</rb><rb>の</rb><rb>すべて</rb>

</ruby>』(_My mysterious[^34] everything_; abbr.「<ruby>

    <rbc><rb>不可</rb><rb>ぼく</rb></rbc>
    <rtc><rt>Fuka</rt><rt>Boku</rt></rtc>
</ruby>」)‼

[^34]:  「不可解」can be translated a few ways here:
        incomprehensible, mysterious, enigmatic, baffling, etc. "Mysterious"
        was chosen here as it sounds best in a title. I should note this may
        also be personal bias, as the other translations imply it is completely
        unknowable, whereas this translation could imply that it is unknown due
        to the reference frame of others.

_FukaBoku_ provides some decent reference for a couple of terms that were
discussed previously. Particularly since the terms are actually either used or
discussed within the work rather than as labels ascribed to it, we can get a
good look at what they mean in the context.

||日本語|English|

|Mogu|鈴はホモなの？|Are you a homo, Suzu?
|Mei?|コラァッ|Hey!
||その言葉は傷つく人が<br/>いるからダメ!!!|Some people find that word hurtful,<br/>so don't say it!
||差別的な<br/>意味が強いからね<br/>(たたいてごめん)|It can be<br/>really discriminatory.<br/>(Sorry for hitting you.)
|Mogu|エッ　そうなの!?|Huh!? Really!?
||ぼく⋯　知らなくて|I... didn't know.
||ごめんね⋯|I'm sorry...
