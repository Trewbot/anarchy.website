title: The Absurdity of <i>Madoka Magica</i>
---

**This post contains spoilers for [Puella Magi Madoka Magic/Mahou Shoujo Madoka
Magica (魔法少女まどか☆マギカ)][1] and Puella Magi Madoka Magica: The Movie
(劇場版 魔法少女まどか☆マギカ) [Beginnings (始まりの物語)][2], [Eternal
(永遠の物語)][3], and [Rebellion (叛逆の物語)][4]. Please watch the show (or
first two movies) and Rebellion before continuing.**

**Introduction**

...

I've [rated the show][5] at $9/10$ for essentially just not being [Neon Genesis
Evangelion][6]. That isn't to say that I would ever directly compare the two
shows, but a full discussion of my rating system is really not the focus here so
I'll spare the full details.

**Overview**

**Genre Subversion**

"It IsN't GeNrE sUbVeRsIoN tO jUsT bE eDgY."

**Madoka as the Absurd Hero**

Madoka is the absurd hero, she exists as a consciousness trapped in an unending
cyclical task as the result of her own actions. Because she chose this, we can
easily imagine her happy.

**Homura's Rebellion**

Homura, however, exists as the natural consequence of such a godly power
spawning from nothing: an opposing power. Rather than accept the absurdity, she
rewrites the fundamentals of that absurdity, abolishing it by its own first
principles.
