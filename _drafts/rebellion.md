title: The Absurdity of <i>Madoka Magica</i>

**This post contains spoilers for [Puella Magi Madoka Magic/Mahou Shoujo Madoka
Magica (魔法少女まどか☆マギカ)][1] and Puella Magi Madoka Magica: The Movie
(劇場版 魔法少女まどか☆マギカ) [Beginnings (始まりの物語)][2], [Eternal
(永遠の物語)][3], and [Rebellion (叛逆の物語)][4]. Please watch the show (or
first two movies) and Rebellion before continuing.**

**Introduction**

Everyone has *some* contrarian opinions, a prevalent example of this being to
claim that the Star Wars prequels were actually good. While I'm sure that I
have plenty of these opinions laying around myself, the one that always seems to
throw me off upon being reminded of it is that Madoka Magica is actually a
pretty decent show. Actually, I don't think there's much use in using such weak
wording here, I didn't just think it was "decent" I thought it was really good
to the point that I, whose average rating on [MyAnimeList][7] is [4.95][8][^1],
gave it a 9/10. If you look at [my list][5] you might even draw the conclusion
that I only gave it a 9 and not a 10 for essentially just not being [Neon
Genesis Evangelion][6].

[^1]:   At the time of writing this I've rated 241 shows, with a mean rating of
        4.95 and a standard deviation of 1.82. See
        <https://graph.anime.plus/Trewbot/ratings,anime> for more details.

One might ask then "why did you like the show so much?" And a few might also be
compelled to ask why this is even a contrarian opinion. It'll be a lot easier to
address this latter question first, and to describe why I think a lot of the
critiques of this show are absolutely incorrect. Before I get into either of
these questions even, I'll go over the show a bit to provide some context. Of
course, if you ignored the spoiler warning at the top of the page, this is a
good time to put in a reminder that this post will contain a lot of spoilers for
the Madoka Magica series and movies; if you haven't seen them then *I guess* I
will basically be explaining the whole thing to you.

**Genre Subversion**

"It IsN't GeNrE sUbVeRsIoN tO jUsT bE eDgY."

I begin to wonder whether or not the critiques of this show are even as common
among the actual audience as they are among some niche group of reviewers, since
according to [MAL][7] my high rating of 9 for the show is actually only 0.55
above the average. Now, it is a very distinct possibility that this is actually
a very common critique, but that this disagreement over whether or not the show
sufficiently meets the requirements for good genre subversion does not affect
people's opinions on the show itself. If I'm to make the assumption that this is
true, then I would have to make a correction to my earlier statement and say
that my opinion is contrarian in that I believe that the show serves as a great
example of genre subversion.

**Madoka as the Absurd Hero**

...

Madoka is the absurd hero, she exists as a consciousness trapped in an unending
cyclical task as the result of her own actions. Because she chose this, we can
easily imagine her happy.

**Homura's Rebellion**

Homura, however, exists as the natural consequence of such a godly power
spawning from nothing: an opposing power. Rather than accept the absurdity, she
rewrites the fundamentals of that absurdity, abolishing it by its own first
principles.

While Madoka may be functionally similar to our absurd hero, she is not also
equivalent to our proletarian of the gods. This key difference is something that
Homura clearly takes advantage of. Since Madoka is not held in her position by
any higher power than herself, changes can be made to the principles defining
her position without also petitioning some higher power. The Myth of Sisyphus
may provide a perfect example of a situation whose horror is remedied simply by
embracing the absurd, Madoka Magica presents a situation that (while not wholly
realistic) analogs the sort of nuance that one would find in more realistic
situations.
