title: Disrupting the Cycle of the Hero
---

"The Absurd Devil"? "The Devil and the Disruption of the Absurd Hero"? I'm not
sure what I should title this, it's all fucking absurd anyway.

Madoka is the absurd hero, she exists as a consciousness trapped in an unending
cyclical task as the result of her own actions. Because she chose this, we can
easily imagine her happy.

Homura, however, exists as the natural consequence of such a godly power
spawning from nothing: an opposing power. Rather than accept the absurdity, she
rewrites the fundamentals of that absurdity, abolishing it by its own first
principles.
