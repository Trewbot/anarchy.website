## Introduction to Commodification

Commodification, the alteration of any resources, products, ideas, et cetera so
as to be sold in a market<sup>[D7](#D7),[D8](#D8)</sup>, is fundamentally
anchored to the idea of attribution of value.
In modern society, we have come to view mathematics as the basis for our
understanding of the world.
This is true in not only physics, but economics and even sociology as a whole.
If we were to simply trade one item for another, it is arguable that the two
parties doing said trading are agreeing on some value for each item in the
trade.
The value doesn't have to necessarily be given a number, just Person A views
Item 1 to have the same value as Person B views Item 2 to
have<sup>[D1](#D1)</sup>.

Nonetheless, any person raised in a world that values mathematics as a necessary
interpretation of all of reality will almost certainly attempt in some regard to
define some mediating value in the aforementioned exchange.

This may not necessarily be a negative trait; however, it is severely flawed in
the assumption that it is the item itself that is given value by the two parties
and not the exchange from the reference frame of each individual party.
In a market, it is the item being exchanged that is given some value, as it is
not being exchanged for property of another party (thus making the exchange
reliant on the value said party attributes to the property), but currency whose
value is defined by some greater collective and infrastructure.
This is, at its core, a compromise of the value the seller attributes to the
item and the social institution of value that the market upholds; whereas, in a
trade of property between two parties, each party is working to find a palatable
medium of the value they attribute to their property and that which the other
party attributes by way of exchanging it for property of the party that both
parties hold equal value to from their respective perspectives.

The buyer in a market is not putting up their property to be traded with your
property, at least not in the immediate sense, and so there is no matching of
attributed value.
Primarily, the value for which an item is sold in a market is based on
prediction, or "speculation," in this specific instance<sup>[D2](#D2)</sup>
the seller must predict what price the sellers of items for which they would be
otherwise willing to trade for the item offered by this seller would sell their
items for in this same market.
Of course, historically one could easily make the argument that this is all mere
pragmatism, must the dairy farmer go each to the general store owner, the
cobbler, the blacksmith, et cetera and bargain with each, offering up milk that
could otherwise be sold for a shared currency that could then be used to buy
items from each of the aforementioned sellers?
No, especially not in the modern system of international markets, but still this
system of commodification has many undesirable side effects that must be
explored and countered.

## Extent in Modern Society

The extent of the problem with commodification cannot be grasped with the
examples put forth above, such examples are built on the assumption of property,
autonomy, control, access, ownership, and, to an extent, the universality of
people's ability to compromise on value<sup>[D3](#D3)</sup>.

In a system wherein a capitalist class, the "bourgeoisie" as they are often
called, exists, this class may choose whether or not to themselves be
commodified, while those of any other class that does not bear any control over
the economy are simply commodified by default.
One particularly stark manifestation of this idea can be found in a slave trade:
those in the slave class are a literal commodity, they are bought and they are
sold; however, the slave traders, the class controlling the trade, is not
subject to the same treatment.
More simply put, the rich may sell themselves while everyone else is forced to
do so.
Certainly, most reading this have never been sold in a slave trade and so the
previous example may be a bit out of their scope, but nonetheless the idea
remains true in the day to day life of the average person today.

## The Special Case of Work

To discuss work, one must be certain of that which is being discussed, giving a
working definition<sup>[D9](#D9)</sup> so as to avoid any confusion.
Here, Black's definition<sup>[D4](#D4)</sup> as clarified by
Ross<sup>[D5](#D5)</sup> is used: work is forced labor.
**Discuss how vague this is and how that is meant to be able to include domestic
and emotional labor as work.**

Not working is incompatible with our current situation: a society built upon
labor<sup>[D4](#D4)</sup>.
This idea was more harshly stated by Wilde<sup>[D10](#D10):

><a name="wilde"></a>The fact is, that civilisation requires slaves. The Greeks
were quite right there. Unless there are slaves to do the ugly, horrible,
uninteresting work, culture and contemplation become almost impossible. Human
slavery is wrong, insecure, and demoralising. On mechanical slavery, on the
slavery of the machine, the future of the world depends.

**Mention this being about automation, transition to how work persists even now
when we have automation.**

Even within [Wilde's statement](#wilde) there exists an indication that
automation will not necessarily end work.
He claims that civilization requires it, that is to say that civilization is
built upon it, and so replacing work done by people with work done by machines
does not imply at all that work will be completely overhauled by the
introduction of the machine; rather, it asserts that automation is the direction
in which we must push so as to eventually abolish work.


**About what not working is like:**
Consequence must still exist without work, simply replacing it with play would
not suffice<sup>[D6](#D6)</sup>.
Play is not necessarily non-productive and so the dichotomy of work and play is
not completely polarized<sup>[D5](#D5)</sup>.

## Æsthetics as a Solution

To simply assert æsthetics as the means by which to counter commodification
would be an essentially meaningless statement.
As æsthetics is that which has no bearing on anything other than itself, the
aforementioned statement would mean nothing more than "just stop being
commodified."
**Give reference to Shaviro's essay**<sup>[D11](#D11)</sup>.

**How do we move from our current state to one of pure aesthetic indulgence?**

**Something about prefigurativism.**

**Some other shit probably about full automation.**

1. <a name="D1"></a>Theoretically, if trades were made in such a system
between three parties (Persons A, B, and C), where Person A trades Item 1 for
Person B's Item 2, Person B trades Person A's original Item 1 for Person C's
Item 3, and finally Person A requests a trade to take back their Item 1 from
Person C, Person C could deny said trade on account of them valuing Item 1
higher than Item 2 (which Person A now has). That is to say that the transitive
property does not necessarily apply in this system, as each trade is itself a
new context in which each item is valued by the parties that hold and request
them. The change in value can be attributed to change in circumstance, Person C
may inherently value anything that they received from Person B as a higher value
than anything they received from Person A by default. It could also be that over
the time between trades Person C found Item 1 very useful and therefore now
attributes higher value to it. If the circumstances are changed slightly such
that it is Person C who is attempting to trade Item 1 back to Person A for Item
2, in such a case the argument could be made that Person A, having been willing
to trade away Item 1 to begin with, has no interest in once again having Item 1.

2. <a name="D2"></a>Speculation is also the source of value in other
instances within a market system, such as stocks being bought and sold based on
the assumed or predicted value of the company backing them.
