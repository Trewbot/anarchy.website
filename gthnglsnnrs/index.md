[Goth Angel Sinners][1] (abbr: ðŸ¥€ðŸ‘¼ðŸ—¡) is a podcast about anarchy, anarchists,
and anarchism; hosted by [Una Ada][2], [Chloe (Î§Î»ÏŒÎ·) Ross][3], and
[Leland (@whimworm)][4]. The podcast is currently hosted on [anchor.fm][1].

Episodes of the podcast (called "parts") are meant to be released regularly on
every [Sextidi][12]; though no such regularity has been achieved as of yet, with
parts being released upon their completion.

An original concept for a podcast was proposed circa August 2017, leading to the
creation of a [Twitter][13] group chat on the 18<sup>th</sup> wherein the title
"Not the Feds" (NTF) was decided on; this title was based on a joke about the
concept for the podcast: to let anyone of left leaning politics join in to
whatever episode if they desired to simply "be on a podcast at some point." This
initial group made some attempt to produce a first episode, then intended to
discuss the upcoming [Catalan independence referendum][6], but due to scheduling
issue was delayed. That delay would in time turn into an extended hiatus and the
near death of the project.

Nearly a year later, on July 9, 2018, the podcast [Neighbor Science][8] (then
hosted by [Ryan Salisbury][14] and [Pieter de Beer][15]) hosted a ["Bloc
Party"][17] to explain what the titular concept of the podcast meant, having on
two guests to aid in the task: Una and Chloe (Î§Î»ÏŒÎ·). After this special,
Una and Chloe decided the whole thing would have been better with just the two
of them, thus revitalizing the concept of a podcast (co-)hosted by the former.

This new podcast was built on the framework of NTF (namely by simply renaming
the existing [Twitter account][16]), but needed a new name to fit with the new
direction. After some brainstorming, the two agreed on the name "Goth Angel
Sinners," a pluralized reference to the unreleased project by the late
[Lil Peep][18] (RIP Lil Peep).

The third episode ([Part III: Spiderman 3][19]) saw the introduction of a third
co-host, [Leland (@whimworm)][4], who had collaborated with Una on past
projects, e.g. the "Monthly Screenplays" with [@punished_picnic][20] (f.k.a.
@ruined_picnic) available from ["The Picnic Archive"][21].
