title: "Goth Angel Sinners Pt. I: Catalonia Notes"
---

 - Intro
   - "_Good Sextidi, everyone, and welcome to part one (1) of Goth Angel
     Sinners, a podcast about anarchy, anarchists, and anarchism. We're your
     hosts @trewbot and Χλόη (Chloe) here today to talk about Catalonia._"
 - The Spanish Civil War
   - Actually not that much interesting to be discussed about it, violent
     revolution sucks in general.
   - The organization of revolutionary forces as a voluntary militia does
     provide an example of non-hierarchical principles in practice even when
     divisions of forces are necessary, however.
 - Anarchist Electoralism
   - Is it contradictory for an anarchist to seek political office? Why is the
     answer no and this is totally like the iPhone argument.
   - The Weebertarians page made
     [a point](https://www.facebook.com/Weebertarians/photos/a.212527982812069/284478375617029/)
     relevant to this:
     - "Some anarchists feel that the transition to statelessness cannot take
       place without first working through the state to protect people from its
       collapse and then rebuild from there."
     - "The end will always be a reflection of the means so create the means how
       they would be in the end to have a natural transition."
     - Must prefigurative politics be exclusive or does a diversity of tactics
       apply?
   - In late 1936, members of the CNT-FAI joined the Catalan government in an
     attempt to counter what they feared to be potential effects of the
     Generalitat of Catalonia being completely controlled by the Unified
     Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC)[^6].
   - If not to expressly use the powers given to an elected candidate to damage
     the state or even to improve material conditions of those living under said
     state, the act of campaigning itself remains a platform. This point is made
     by Jae Em Carico with regards to their current bid for the U.S. Senate in
     Tennessee[^1].
 - Revolutionary Catalonia
   - Expropriation of churches for use as community distribution centers.
 - Catalonian Independence (2017)
   - Accusations that anarchists supported the referendum due to the existence
     of Revolutionary Catalonia in 1936 as opposed to the support of a group of
     people's right to self determination.
   - Is self determination for nations or regions that intend to found nations a
     reasonable thing to accept for anarchists?
   - Declaration that the referendum was "undemocratic" by the Spanish King[^2].
     A continuation of the fascist/monarchist systems that Spain has maintained
     in opposition to republicanism.
     - The formation of the modern Spanish government and the end of the Franco
       Era brought about Autonomous Communities (comparable to states).
     - Spain is "not a federation" because the country is inherently unitary but
       power is "devolved" to the communities.[^3]
     - Since the Spanish government declares itself as "democratic," it defines
       "democratic" as whatever falls in line with its policies.
       - Is this the most egregious transgression ever to occur in the realm of
         linguistics?
       - Can this system of Government even be considered Democratic?
     - Historical Anecdote: Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco's assassination in 1973.
       - Blanco was prime minister and heir apparent in Franco's regime.
       - Assassinated on December 20, 1973 by the Basque separatist group Eta
         using a car bomb that launched his vehicle on the order of 20 feet into
         the air.
       - In March of 2017, Cassandra Vera was arrested in Spain for "glorifying
         terrorism" after she made several jokes about the incident[^4]. Her
         sentence was later overturned, probably because it seemed a bit too
         fascist even for Spain[^5].
   - Economic arguments against Catalonian Independence were extremely common
     around the time of the referendum.
 - Outro
   - "_Have a good night and be sure to join us next Sextidi for part two (2) of
      Goth Angel Sinners when we discuss the works and philosophy of Oscar
      Wilde._"
