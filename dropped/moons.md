## Chapter 1

"When I stepped off onto that moon, it felt lonely, sure, but I didn't feel
alone. It was like if the girl you liked left you on read for months but she
lived just across the hall, that sort of lonely," he paused, just staring off
into the distance as if deep in thought. "I don't know what it was. There was
something. I could feel it, I could feel it ignoring me. I wanted it to love
me, even though I had no idea who or what it was or if it even existed, I just
needed it to validate my feelings."

"Did you ever actually, y'know, find anything up there?"

"No, I guess it was just a feeling. I expected emptiness, but instead I got
this longing feeling. Like, I just wanted to say 'I'm home' and sit down at the
table with her."

"Her?"

"The, uhh, her... oh, shit, I really have no idea what I'm saying right now.
It's all very confusing. I nearly collapsed crying up there, on that moon. Just
thinking about everything that happened had got me holding back tears  again."
The man's voice began to crackle a bit, he was starting to sound like an old
man reminiscing about a long-lost love from his days of youth.

"Let me ask you again, then, did you ever actually meet her?"

"What, no? I, what? I just, heh, I said I didn't..." he trailed off, his eyes
began watering, a tear or two began rolling down his  cheek. He really
shouldn't be hiding anything, what is there to hide? It was all on camera. They
already saw everything.

"Look, Eric, we know what happened, we already saw everything. So, just answer
me clearly now: did you or did you not see her when you were up there?"

"I fucking- I-I told you already, I fucking- I didn't meet-"
