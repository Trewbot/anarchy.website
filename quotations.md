This is a collection of various quotations I've stumbled across that I found to
be interesting or well put. Some of them are brief and concise statements of
concepts that I could never dream to word better and others are simply phrases
that I believe are humorous to reference as quotations by their respective
authors.

## Automation

 -  "The fact is, that civilisation [sic] requires slaves. The Greeks were quite
    right there. Unless there are slaves to do the ugly, horrible, uninteresting
    work, culture and contemplation become almost impossible. Human slavery is
    wrong, insecure, and demoralising [sic]. On mechanical slavery, on the
    slavery of the machine, the future of the world depends." &mdash; Oscar
    Wilde

## Linguistics

 -  "The more I think about language, the more it amazes me that people ever
    understand each other at all." &mdash; Kurt Gödel

## Mathematics

 -  "If a 'religion' is defined to be a system of ideas that contains unprovable
    statements, then Gödel taught us that mathematics is not only a religion, it
    is the only religion that can prove itself to be one." &mdash; John D.
    Barrow

 -  "Either mathematics is too big for the human mind, or the human mind is more
    than a machine." &mdash; Kurt Gödel

 -  "[A]fter a few fleeting and futile attempts..." (*[N]ach einigen flüchtigen
    vergeblichen Versuchen...*) &mdash; Bernhard Riemann

## Money

 -  "Man should not be ready to show that he can live like a badly fed animal. He
    should decline to live like that, and should either steal or go on [welfare],
    which is considered by many to be a form of stealing." &mdash; Oscar Wilde

 -  "Rockefeller, if you were to come to Fraga with your entire bank account you
    would not be able to buy a cup of coffee. Money, your God and your servant,
    has been abolished here, and the people are happy." (*Rockefeller, wenn Du
    nach Fraga kommst und Dein ganzes Bankkonto mitbringst, kannst Du dafür
    nicht einmal einen Café con leche kaufen. Das Geld, Dein Gott und Dein
    Diener, ist hier abgeschafft und die Menschen sind glücklich.*) &mdash; Die
    Soziale Revolution

## Video Games

 -  "Among Mario's imitations, Sonic is a good one." &mdash; Shigeru Miyamoto
    (宮本 茂)

## Misc.

 -  "But that was just a dream<br>
    That was just a dream" &mdash; R.E.M.

 -  "Airplane mode is on my phone<br>
    And I just kick it with my cat, ay" &mdash; guardin

 -  "I'm not suicidal I don't wanna fucking die<br>
    Just wanna be able to close my eyes and feel alright" &mdash; Jake Hill

 -  "I do not write to earn a living or to build a reputation. I write to battle
    enemies." &mdash; Ba Jin (巴金)
