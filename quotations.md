This is a collection of various quotations I've stumbled across that I found to
be interesting or well put. Some of them are brief and concise statements of
concepts that I could never dream to word better and others are simply phrases
that I believe are humorous to reference as quotations by their respective
authors.

## Automation

 -  "The fact is, that civilisation requires slaves. The Greeks were quite right
    there. Unless there are slaves to do the ugly, horrible, uninteresting work,
    culture and contemplation become almost impossible. Human slavery is wrong,
    insecure, and demoralising. On mechanical slavery, on the slavery of the
    machine, the future of the world depends." &mdash; Oscar Wilde

## Linguistics

 -  "The more I think about language, the more it amazes me that people ever
    understand each other at all." &mdash; Kurt Gödel

## Mathematics

 -  "If a 'religion' is defined to be a system of ideas that contains unprovable
    statements, then Gödel taught us that mathematics is not only a religion, it
    is the only religion that can prove itself to be one." &mdash; John D.
    Barrow

 -  "Either mathematics is too big for the human mind, or the human mind is more
    than a machine." &mdash; Kurt Gödel

 -  "[A]fter a few fleeting and futile attempts..." (*[N]ach einigen flüchtigen
    vergeblichen Versuchen...*) &mdash; Bernhard Riemann
