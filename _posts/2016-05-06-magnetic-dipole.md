## Introduction

Oscillations are among the most important motions to understand when dealing
with physics on both a macro and micro scale; the oscillation of an object can
be used to determine specific properties of said object, especially in the case
of magnets and magnetic fields <sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. In this case, we
placed a cue ball containing a magnetic dipole in a constant magnetic field
generated by an approximately <sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Helmholtz coil (so
as to create a consistent magnetic field in the area that the cue ball was
placed) and allowed it to oscillate. By changing the current through the coil
<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> and measuring the change in the frequency of
oscillations, we were able to calculate the strength of the magnetic dipole.
Given the input of the current (our independent variable) and the output of the
frequency (our dependent variable), a simple way to draw a comparison between
the two was to find a method by which we could linearize the graph of the values
such that the slope of the line would be our value for the magnetic dipole. To
linearize this graph, we could not have just placed the raw values on the axes,
rather we needed to calculate values that depended on these raw values.

Newtonâ€™s second law states that the sum of the torques on a system will be equal
to the moment of inertia times the angular acceleration, which is written as
