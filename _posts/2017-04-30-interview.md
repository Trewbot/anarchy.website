FADE IN:
INT. Office
Opening shot of an INTERVIEWER holding a clipboard and sitting at a desk in a
plain room. There is an INTERVIEWEE on the other side of the desk but both
characters will never be in the same shot.

                                INTERVIEWER
			What is something that you believe in?

                                INTERVIEWEE
			Pardon?

                                INTERVIEWER
	        Yknow, something that you agree with completely, an idea
            that you feel is an integral part of you.

INTERVIEWEE pauses to think, the anthem of Soviet Russia begins to play,
increasing in volume as a waving soviet flag fades in over the shot. Both the
anthem and flag abruptly disappear as INTERVIEWEE answers.

                                INTERVIEWEE
			Object permanence.

                                INTERVIEWER
			What?

                                INTERVIEWEE
				            (shifting in seat)
	        Yeah, you know, some people just don't believe in object
            permanence these days, but I've always been a strong
            supporter. Things don't just disappear because you
            don't see them anymore. Today's progressive youths are
            going too far in their rebellion against traditional
            ideas.
