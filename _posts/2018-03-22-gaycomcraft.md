## Included Mods

Most links in this table are shortened using [goo.gl](https://goo.gl) because a
lot of people's website and blogs have very long URLs and I like the source code
for these pages to be just as legible as the end result. You shouldn't need any
of these links other than for information about the mods, but it's convenient to
have all the licenses and download links in one place for liability or something
I don't know.

## Download

The modpack is currently hosted on this site and can be downloaded using this
link: [gaycomcraft-0.1.0](/assets/dl/gaycomcraft-0.1.0.zip).

## Installation

These instructions assume you own a legitimate copy of Minecraft and are using a
Windows OS. They may also be overly detailed, but for some reason a lot of the
buttons and options are not very intuitive.

1. Download the Minecraft launcher from [minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net).

2. Run the launcher.

3. Select the "Launch options" tab from the top menu.

4. Click "(+) Add new."

5. Select "release 1.7.10" for "Version."

6. Click "Save."

7. Select the "News" tab from the top menu.

8. Click the "^" button adjacent to the "Play" button.

9. Select the configuration with the "1.7.10" subtitle.

10. Click "Play."

11. When the game finishes downloading and the main menu opens, close the game.

12. Download the Forge installer from
[minecraftforge.net](https://goo.gl/7nMG7R).

13. Run the installer.

14. Leave all the options on the installer at default and click "OK."

15. When the installer is finished click "OK" to close it.

16. Open the Minecraft launcher.

17. If you would like to use the default configuration created by forge, you can
skip steps 17-22. Select the "Launch options" tab from the top menu.

18. Click "(+) Add new."

19. (Optional) Since you will actually be using this configuration to play, you
may want to add a name in the "Name" field.

20. Select "release 1.7.10-Forge10.13.4.1614-1.7.10" (the exact
version numbers may vary if you selected a different download from the Forge
website) for "Version," it should be near the bottom.

21. (Optional) To add more than the default amount of RAM (1GB) to this
configuration, toggle the switch next to "JVM Arguments," then change the "1" in
"-Xmx1G" in the adjacent field to the desired amount of RAM in GBs.

22. Select the "News" tab from the top menu.

23. Click the "^" button adjacent to the "Play" button.

24. Select the configuration that you just created (or the "Forge" configuration
if you skipped 17-22).

25. Download the modpack from the above section.

26. Using the run dialog (windows key + R) or the navigation bar in Windows
Explorer, navigate to `%appdata%/.minecraft`.

27. Open the folder called `mods`, if it does not exist create it then open it.

28. Open the folder called `1.7.10`, if it does not exist create it then open
it.

29. Copy the contents of the modpack's .zip file into the `1.7.10` folder.

30. (Optional) Download Optifine [here](https://goo.gl/G6nGWW) and move it into
this folder as well.

31. Return to the launcher and click "Play." (assuming the previous
configuration is still selected).

## Footnotes

1. <a name="1"></a>The CurseForge page for Baubles refers to the MineCraft Forum
page as the main thread. This thread states "go wild" in reference to usage in
modpacks, wheras the CurseForge page does include a CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license
which would also allow usage in modpacks so long as they are non-commercial and
are released under a similar license.

2. <a name="2"></a>See "copyright.txt" in the mod's .jar file.

3. <a name="3"></a>Lucky Block could be included if this wasn't
considered a "public modpack," but having everything open and public is just
easier than not doing so. Also, it could totally still be included if you don't
respect "Australian Copyright Law", which... I mean...

4. <a name="4"></a>OptiFine's official description according to their website
states that it cannot be redistributed, but you should probably download it
yourself. It isn't absolutely necessary, however, since it is purely client side
and does not affect servers.

5. <a name="5"></a>The author of Witchery _does_ allow it in modpacks _if_ you
send them a private message on Minecraft Forum, but I'd have to find some way to
reactivate my account or just register a new one to do that because I haven't
touched it in like 6 years.
