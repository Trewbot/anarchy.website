## ARTICLE V OPERATING PROCEDURES

### §5.1 MEETINGS

General member meetings for the UWRF ACM shall be held at an agreed time and
interval that shall be voted upon during the first available week of the new
semester by a quorum of the current active members. To maximize the amount of
members that are able to provide input about when meetings should be held, it is
suggested that an electronic ballot be used, allowing more than just those
members who are able to attend the first meeting to vote. The recommended
interval for these meetings is once per week. These meetings shall operate under
the purpose of gathering ideas and feedback from UWRF ACM members, planning
events, and discussing topics relevant to the members of the chapter. The
Secretary is charged with preparing an agenda for these meetings and
distributing said agenda at least twenty-four (24) hours before the meeting. The
Secretary must also take meeting minutes during the meeting and make said
minutes publicly available at most twenty-four (24) hours after the meeting.

Officer meetings for the UWRF ACM shall be held regularly at an agreed time and
interval and shall be voted upon during the first available week of the new
semester by all UWRF ACM officers. The decision to schedule the officer meetings
must be decided unanimously to ensure maximum attendance of the officers. The
recommended interval for these meetings is once per week, an hour before the
general member meetings, allowing all decisions made during the officer meetings
to be immediately discussed with the chapter membership. As outlined in the
previous paragraph, the Secretary is charged with creating an agenda and minutes
for officer meetings as well.

Each committee is suggested to also hold meetings at a regular time and
interval. This should be decided based on the same procedure as general member
meetings, except that the quorum would be based on the membership of that
individual committee rather than the chapter. This is not required as each
committees duties may be discussed and directed during the general member
meetings.

### §5.2 AGENDA

The UWRF ACM officers are to communicate with each other to decide upon the
topics of each officer meeting and general member meeting. Any officer or
general member may contribute reasonable topics to be added to these agendas. It
is the duty of the Secretary to then compile and distribute these agendas. It is
important that the agendas are distributed no sooner than twenty-four (24) hours
before the meetings so that those attending may think ahead as to what they
would like to say about the topics on the agenda, therefore leading to more
effective use of the meeting time.

### §5.3 EVENT PLANNING

Ultimately, the coordination of any event is left up to the discretion of the
UWRF ACM officers. However, it is recommended that the following procedure be
followed to ensure that operation of the event runs smoothly and that all
available resources are able to be utilized.

1.	Propose an idea for an event to the UWRF ACM officers.
2.	The officers will then put the discussion of the event on the agenda for the
    next general member meeting. They may also put the discussion on the agenda
    for the next officer meeting. All suggestions for agenda items should be
    proposed well more than twenty-four (24) hours before the meeting itself so
    as to give the officers time to add the item to the agenda and still
    distribute the agenda with a twenty-four (24) hour window before the
    meeting.
3.	The coordination of the event will then be passed off to the UWRF ACM Events
    Committee. Within the Event Committee a subcommittee is formed with the
    purpose of coordinating the proposed event. The person who suggests the
    event may be asked to head this subcommittee.
4.	The subcommittee then decides on a time and place to host the event. If it
    is deemed necessary, this decision can be made via a vote at a general
    member meeting. To hold a vote on the matter, propose the idea to the
    officers who will then place the vote on the agenda. It is recommended that
    this be done well more than twenty-four (24) hours before the meeting during
    which the vote is to be held.
5.	Once the topic, time, and place of the event are all agreed upon, the
    subcommittee shifts focus to fundraising. This can be through the club or
    another sponsor.
6.	After acquiring the funding for the event,

### §5.4 EVENT OR MEETING CANCELATION

In the situation that an event or meeting must be canceled, there must be
notification sent to the officers by the sponsor of the event no later than
twenty-four (24) hours before the time the event was scheduled to be held. It is
recommended that the sponsor also notify all those who planned to attend the
event themselves, though the UWRF ACM will attempt to also notify its members of
the change. The sponsor should also give clear reasoning for their choice to
cancel the event. It is up to the discretion of the event sponsor whether an
event be canceled for any reason. What serves as a valid reason for the
cancelation of an event is also up to the discretion of the event sponsor. It is
recommended that the cancelation of an event be based on a situation that would
likely result in a significant drop in attendance (e.g. national emergencies or
severe weather) or one that would lead to putting the attendees in danger (e.g.
threats to the venue).

### §5.5 MEMBER ETIQUETTE

All members represent the UWRF ACM and should act with appropriate behavior and
respect on and off campus. All officers must demonstrate leadership and
willingness to better the chapter with reasonable means and judgement. The
purpose of this organization is to engage students to expand their knowledge
their knowledge of computer science and technology.

## ARTICLE VI ELECTIONS

### §6.1 GENERAL ELECTION INFORMATION

Elections for UWRF ACM officer and committee chair positions are to be held
annually in April. Any UWRF student involved in the UWRF ACM is eligible to run
for any officer or committee chair position. Each student may run for multiple
officer positions, but may only accept one of said positions if elected. Each
student may also run for multiple committee chair positions (this may also be
done concurrently while running for officer position(s)), but may only accept
one of said positions if elected. If a candidate is elected to an officer
position and also a committee chair positon, but the officer position is
required to fill in for a vacant committee chair position, then the candidate
may only accept the officer position and temporarily fill in the vacant
committee chair position.

The full list of officers to be elected is as follows:
1.	Chair
2.	Vice Chair
3.	Secretary
4.	Treasurer
5.	Membership Officer

The full list of committee chairs and who shall fill their position if vacant is
as follows:
1.	Lab Manager (filled by Chair)
2.	Events Committee Chair (filled by Vice Chair)
3.	Communications Committee Chair (filled by Secretary)

The Webmaster is not elected by the general population, but after the election
they are selected by a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote of the UWRF ACM officers
and the Communications Committee Chair.

As those holding officer positions are limited to being UWRF students, there are
no term limits for officers. A term limit would lead to constant switching out
of the experienced officers for new, inexperienced ones. As such, it is not
recommended that there be any term limits so long as the officer remains
qualified and reelected for the position.

### §6.2 ELECTION PROCEDURES

Throughout the March preceding each April election (the beginning of the
election process) ACM members shall nominate candidates for officer or committee
chair positions. All nominations shall be given in writing or verbally to the
current UWRF ACM officers. Self-nominations are acceptable.

Once a full list of candidates for each positions is compiled, said list must be
made publicly available and all members of the UWRF ACM must be notified of said
list’s existence. This can be done at the regular member meetings or via social
media. This must be done at least one week prior to the date the elections are
intended to be held. Candidates may also be asked to release personal statements
to accompany this list, so as to allow the members to begin their process of
deciding for whom they would like to vote.

At least one week after the list of candidates is released, the officer and
committee chair election shall be held at the first convenient general member
meeting at which there will be a quorum of the members. If the election is to be
held electronically, then the poll shall be open for at least seventy-two (72)
hours and all members must be notified so as to achieve a quorum. It is
recommended that any electronic means of voting keep the identities behind each
vote confidential.

Each member of the UWRF ACM is allowed exactly one (1) vote per open position.
At the meeting during which the vote is to be held (or at the last meeting
before the poll is to be opened for electronic voting) each candidate must give
a short speech describing why they believe themselves to be the best candidate
for any position they are running for and how they plan to carry out all the
responsibilities of said positions. After this speech, the candidate shall be
asked to leave the room for no more than five (5) minutes while the other
present members discuss their views on the candidate’s run for the position. In
the case that hand written ballots are to be used, all candidates for a position
may be asked to leave the room while other members fill out their ballots and
the votes are counted, this should be immediately after all candidates have
given their speeches for that position.

All officers and committee chairs begin their official term at the beginning of
the academic year following the election.

### §6.3 RESIGNATION OF AN OFFICER OR COMMITTEE CHAIR

Any UWRF ACM officer or Committee Chair may resign from their position should
they deem it necessary. In the case that an officer or committee chair decides
that they intend to resign, they must submit a written notification of their
resignation to the UWRF ACM officers. The discussion of their resignation must
then be put on the agenda for the upcoming general member meeting. If the
officer or committee chair submits a notification of resignation less than
twenty-four (24) hours before the upcoming general member meeting, than the
discussion shall be placed on the agenda of the meeting following the upcoming
meeting.

During the discussion of their resignation, nominations for their replacement
shall be made. This shall follow an accelerated process compared to that of the
typical election procedures. The list of candidates and their personal
statements must be compiled within three (3) days following the meeting at which
the officer or committee chair’s resignation is discussed. Any member may be
nominated for the position other than current officers and committee chairs.
Self-nominations are acceptable.

A special election shall then be held at the following general member meeting to
elect a replacement officer or committee chair.

### §6.4 REMOVAL OF AN OFFICER OR COMMITTEE CHAIR

Any UWRF ACM officer or committee chair may be removed from their position if it
is deemed necessary by the majority of the UWRF ACM members. In the case that a
member believes that an officer or committee chair is not fit to serve in their
position, said member must submit a written notification that they intend to
remove said officer or committee chair at least twenty-four (24) hours before
the next general member meeting at which they intend to discuss said removal.

During the discussion of the removal of the officer or committee chair, the
member that proposed the removal shall give a statement as to why they believe
the officer or committee chair should be removed. The officer or committee chair
must then give a speech or statement describing their position on the matter.
When both parties have discussed their positions, discussion will be extended to
all present members. The officer or committee chair whose removal is being
discussed may not be asked to leave the room, but they are free to do so of
their own free will. So long as the officer or committee chair whose removal is
being discussed is in the room, they shall be given the opportunity to defend
themselves against any claim made by any present member.

Voting on whether the officer or committee chair shall be removed may take place
directly after the discussion so long as there is a quorum of members present.
If there is not a quorum present, then the voting shall be moved to the next
general member meeting at which a quorum is present. This vote may also be done
electronically, removing the necessity of a present quorum so long as a quorum
has access to the medium of voting. Each member is allowed one (1) vote as to
whether or not the officer or committee chair should be removed. The question on
the ballot must meet the following format: “Do you believe [officer or committee
chair’s name] is unfit to serve in the position ([position held]), and should
therefore be removed?” and the available answers must be “yes” and “no.”

### §6.5 SPECIAL ELECTIONS

The procedure during the meeting at which a special election is to take place is
the exact same as that during the regular annual elections. All officers and
committee chairs elected during a special election begin their term immediately
and end their term at the beginning of the academic year following the special
election.

## ARTICLE VII AMENDMENTS

### §7.1 AMENDMENT PROPOSAL

Any current member of the UWRF ACM may propose an amendment to these bylaws. The
proposal must be submitted in writing to all of the UWRF ACM officers. The UWRF
ACM officers will discuss the validity of the proposal at the next officer
meeting and decide whether or not to vote on it. In the case that they do decide
that the amendment should be voted on, the vote shall be added to the agenda of
the next officer meeting and the written amendment shall be made publicly
available for all members to review.

### §7.2 VOTING ON AMENDMENTS

If the UWRF ACM officers decide to vote on a proposed amendment, a vote may take
place at a regularly scheduled officer meeting. Only officers may vote on
proposed amendments. This includes: Chair, Vice Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, and
Membership Officer.

In order for an amendment to pass, at least a two-thirds (2/3) majority is
needed from all UWRF ACM officers along with the approval of the UWRF ACM
faculty advisor.
