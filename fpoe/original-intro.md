title: The False Paragon of Evil (Original Introduction Draft)
---

There exists a tendency in a major portion of our modern speech, and language in
general, to uphold oneself in contrast to some general group considered to be
inferior. This is commonly referred to as "punching down" and we see it in terms
such as "lame" or "dumb" being used as insults. To a further extent we see the
concept of (general) intelligence used as a basis for many of these, see
"stupid," "moron," and "imbecile" for example. A lot of this is more cultural
and abstract than any sort of direct denotation, people merely call others these
terms as a means of brushing them off as intellectually inferior without any
further thought. However, at the end of this abstract concept we find terms like
"retarded" where people are much more willing to delve into an actual definition
of the word to further their attempt at insult, they'll double down and explain
that they are calling the person "slow" or "intellectually underdeveloped." This
is not to say that this never happens with the previous terms, but that it would
typically only happen with said terms in obscure edge cases rather than your
regular conversation. What we can determine from this is that people are in many
cases simultaneously attempting to harm someone with an immediate insult and
trying to establish an analysis by which to justify the insult. We see this more
cogently in the terms that are the focus of this work: "sociopath" and
"psychopath."

As opposed to many of the aforementioned examples, "sociopath" and "psychopath"
are unique in that they also represent a conceptual issue in the popular
perceptions of psychiatric work. This is, of course, not unique to these terms,
this trivialization of mental illness can be seen in plenty of other places.
What should draw our attention here is that while many other examples of this
trivialization are primarily used as a sort of self diagnosis (such as claiming
one's self to have clinical depression due to a period of lost motivation or to
have an anxiety disorder due to an unwillingness to speak in front of crowds),
these terms are more typically used to diagnose others. In its most extreme we
see this concept manifested in news media, be it about criminals or
politicians. See, for example, a recent [Huffington Post][62] article[^82]
titled "Twitter Explodes After 'Psychopath' Donald Trump Cheers Body-Slamming
of Reporter," where the term "psychopath" is mirrored from a tweet quoted within
the content of the article, but nonetheless is used to call a politician a
psychopath based on publicly displayed views or actions.

Perhaps more blatant an example of this as well as an explanation of some
popular perceptions of "psychopathic personality" specifically is this passage
from chapter eight of Kurt Vonnegut's _A Man Without A Country_:[^94]

[^94]: Kurt Vonnegut, _A Man Without a Country_, ed. Deniel Simon, (New York:
       Seven Stories Press, 2005).

>   "_George W. Bush has gathered around him [...] psychopathic personalities,
    or PPs, the medical term for smart, personable people who have no
    consciences. To say somebody is a PP is to make a perfectly
    respectable diagnosis, like saying he or she has appendicitis or athlete's
    foot. [...] PPs are presentable, they know full well the suffering their
    actions may cause others, but they do not care. They cannot care because
    they are nuts. They have a screw loose! [...] So many of these heartless PPs
    now hold big jobs in our federal government, as though they were leaders
    instead of sick. They have taken charge. They have taken charge of
    communications and the schools, so we might as well be Poland under
    occupation._"

However, at the time of writing this, the most likely place you'll find either
of the topical terms is a number of articles pertaining to [Shane Dawson][64]'s
recent documentary series on the [YouTube][65] platform: [_The Mind of Jake
Paul_][66].[^83]

For the sake of argument and the establishment of context we'll quickly go over
some of the issues present in this documentary series; before doing so I,
reluctantly, recommend you watch at least the first two parts of the series
([link here][66]) to ensure that the points therein are properly represented
here and to understand the further context. With the due diligence done, we can
discuss the work more or less point by point.

Less than seven minutes into the first episode the viewer will see what
constituted a large portion of the controversy surrounding this series, that
being the tone with which it presents the concept of sociopathy. Here this tone
is made blatantly clear with the word "sociopath" plastered on screen in a
manner that presents it as shocking and scary.[^106] He goes on to say he did
not intend to make a documentary about [Jake Paul][101] but broadly about
sociopaths[^110] which he describes as "someone who doesn't have a sense of
morality... [who enjoys] manipulating people."[^107]

[^106]: Dawson, _... Jake Paul_ 1: 6′.

[^110]: This detail, while seemingly banal, is significant in that it indicates
        the framing (and to an extent the bias) of the documentary series as a
        whole. Dawson did not begin research on Jake Paul and subsequently
        conclude that he must be a sociopath, rather he began work on sociopathy
        and moved on to focus on Paul as an example of it.

[^107]: Dawson, _... Jake Paul_ 1: 8′.

The attempt to refer to experts on this topic begins with a citation of ["Dr.
Phil" McGraw][98] who claims "[sociopaths] don't get better." Dawson then also
cites a therapist, [Kati Morton][99], who he had previously been in contact with
and who later in the episode begins consulting on the documentary, specifically
referencing that she had told him she believed multiple "YouTubers" were
sociopaths.[^108] This leads to a discussion of "needing to be sociopathic or
narcissistic" to maintain the sort of presence that "YouTubers" maintain.[^109]
This then leads into an extended discussion on the effects of popularity and
platformism that takes up a good portion of the episode, similar to discussions
one finds about reality television and the extent to which the personality
portrayed is representative of that of the portrayer.

[^108]: Dawson, _... Jake Paul_ 1: 13′.

[^109]: Dawson, _... Jake Paul_ 1: 14′.

Discussion is brought back to sociopathy after approximated fifteen
minutes,[^111][^112] but then shifted back to describing on Paul's
personality.[^113] This line of discussion is then pushed back to exclusively
describing Paul in terms of sociopathy by Dawson.[^114] Nearing the end of the
first episode they bring up the relationship between Jake Paul and his brother,
[Logan Paul][100].[^115]

[^111]: Dawson, _... Jake Paul_ 1: 28′.

[^112]: Dawson, _... Jake Paul_ 1: 30′.

[^113]: Dawson, _... Jake Paul_ 1: 33′.

[^114]: Similar to when he admitted his original goal was to discuss
        sociopaths[^110], this detail is an indicator of the framing the
        documentary series as a whole is done within.

[^115]: Dawson, _... Jake Paul_ 1: 36′.

Just a couple minutes into episode two a clip from the introduction to Kati
Morton's [video on antisocial personality disorder][106] is used, stating "hey
everybody, today I want to talk to you about the word 'psychopath.'"[^116][^117]
The clip is used to establish both tone and the voice of Morton who acts as the
clarifying expert throughout the episode. Shortly afterwards she is introduced
in person and begins to explain sociopathy, or more fittingly 'sociopaths.' This
is initially done by describing a feeling or sense she has for them and more
concretely by stating that they are defined by a "lack of empathy."[^118] This
then brings Morton to mention antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), the
definition of which she reads directly out of the [_Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders_][107] (DSM),[^119] the implication being that ASPD
is a formalization of the concept of sociopathy which is supported by others in
her field.[^120]

[^116]: Dawson, _... Jake Paul_ 2: 2′.

[^117]: Kati Morton, "[What does Psychopath mean? Antisocial Personality
        Disorder][106]," _Mental Health Help with Kati Morton_, YouTube, 2014.

[^118]: Dawson, _... Jake Paul_ 2: 9′.

[^119]: Dawson, _... Jake Paul_ 2: 10′.

[^120]: David Porter, "[Antisocial Personality Disorder DSM-5 301.7
        (F60.2)][108]," [theravive][109], accessed Dec. 1, 2018.

Perhaps the first interesting analytical point made with regards to sociopathy
comes when Morton mentions "social learning" and claims that sociopaths learn to
mimic the actions of others without "feeling the feelings."[^121] Another common
concept pertaining to sociopathy is eventually brought up (again referencing the
DSM) with the mention of "narcissism." Morton describes narcissism as having a
similar form of manipulation of others but with the perpetrator being capable of
remorse and feeling empathy for others.[^122]

[^121]: Dawson, _... Jake Paul_ 2: 17′.

[^122]: Dawson, _... Jake Paul_ 2: 24′.

A statistic is mentioned at one point, one that is particularly interesting and
thus deserves to be singled out here: about 1 in 25 (or around 4%) of people are
sociopaths.[^123]

[^123]: Dawson, _... Jake Paul_ 2: 26′.

"Empaths" are also mentioned, which Morton describes as the "opposite" of
sociopaths as they have a higher than normal amount of empathy for others rather
than none.[^124] She also claims that empaths are likely to attracts sociopaths
since they are easily manipulated by them. This leads back to discussing
"YouTubers" and people overlooking sociopathic behaviors,[^125] a discussion
that culminates in Dawson exclaiming "we're like detectives."[^126]

This series (including the six later episodes not discussed here) garnered a
fair amount of backlash, some of which was immediately addressed by Dawson in a
Snapchat story. He mentions the critique that the term "sociopath" is itself an
issue and defends his usage by claiming his sources on the matter had assured
him that people that the word describes are fundamentally incapable of being
offended.[^130] He then also defends the lack of total factuality in the series
for the purposes of entertainment.[^130][^131] Dawson then foes on to reference
fiction, as is an oddly common act in the description of socio- and psychopathy,
claiming that a work described but avoided labeling a sociopath and that this
was indicative of people being secretive about sociopathy[^130]. The claim that
people are hiding the truth of this matter was also indicated in the documentary
series itself with the line "they don't talk about this in school."[^123]

[^130]: Shane Dawson, Snapchat, [Sep. 28, 2018][116] (archived on YouTube).

[^131]: This point is an outlier here in that it will not be addressed in this
        work, but may be addressed in works on this site in the future.

In further response to the backlash to the series, Dawson posted several tweets
defending the tone of the series. Initially exonerating Morton by stating her
appearance was meant to be "relaxed and real" and that she was not responsible
for the editing that framed the whole conversation in an odious manner.[^127] He
then went on to defend his framing of sociopaths as a whole, claiming he did not
mean to describe sociopaths themselves as "gross" but still stands by his
describing the discussion of sociopathy and its symptoms to be as
such.[^128][^129]

[^127]: Shane Dawson ([@shanedawson][112]), "Kati is my friend and i wanted our
        conversation to be relaxed and real. we both got comfortable and didn’t
        think everything through. but i think the music and b roll just enhanced
        everything which was 100% my fault. she didn’t know i was gonna do that.
        🙏🏻❤️," Twitter, [Oct. 4, 2018][113].

[^128]: Shane Dawson ([@shanedawson][112]), "i’ve suffered from bulimia, body
        dysmorphia and depression for the last 15 years. i would 100% consider
        the feeling i have when talking about those things to be “creepy”
        “gross” and “icky”. it’s not me that’s icky. it’s the feeling i get when
        describing them. i totally (1/2)," Twitter, [Oct. 4, 2018][114].

[^129]: Shane Dawson ([@shanedawson][112]), "(2/2) understand why people are
        upset but i think it’s important to see it from all sides. are
        sociopaths gross? no. does it feel gross when u think about a sociopath
        acting out one of the symptoms? depends on who you are. but once again,
        i shouldn’t have made it scary 1000% 🙏🏻," Twitter, [Oct. 4, 2018][115].

The language discussed here is always an issue, something that comes up quite
often (especially around the time of mass shootings here in the U.S. when many
are compelled to immediately attribute the actions to mental illness[^84]), and
I've personally attempted to make the issues with it clear to those around me
but the publication of this documentary series by such a high profile content
creator brought about a new and potent wave of discourse around it.

[^84]: This particular phenomenon, that of the tragedies uniquely common to the
       United States being attributed to mental conditions supposedly
       universally common, deserves an entire discussion of its own and will not
       be discussed at any length here.

Through discussion of the concept, it became clear that we would benefit from a
more thorough work to which we could refer, one that would contain citations and
explanations so as to avoid the confusion and misunderstanding that plagues most
discussions on the internet. And so, with the encouragement of
[@CheechGuevara][59], I spent nearly the entirety of Vendémiaire thru Frimaire
CCXXVII[^79] (and a sadly considerable bit of Nivôse as well) researching this
topic to ensure that this essay thoroughly describes the tumultuous history of
the terms psychopath and sociopath, as well as the issues with its current
conception.

[^79]: I started writing this on 6 Vendémiaire CCXXVII, based on the [equinox
       method][60] for handling leap years on the Republican Calendar. And, to
       be fair, there is no shortage of times within this essay in which I must
       describe how men in positions of influence wanted entire swaths of people
       (often including myself) to be killed off, so some time to process is
       forgivable, in my opinion.
