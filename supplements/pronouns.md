## Footnotes

[^1]:   Before vowels.

[^2]:   What is the point of the slash when one could simply do "h'self"? 'Tis
        truly a mystery.

[^3]:   The term "Derived" here is used to refer to sets that are derived
        from traditional pronouns. These could be considered canonical in that
        they are created from the "standard" inventory, though their actual
        usage is inconsistently implemented (and also cringe).

[^4]:   The term "Proposed" here is used for those sets that have been proposed
        as gender neutral alternatives, but there is little implementation of
        them as such.

    The list is taken from the [Wikipedia page on third-person pronouns][2], and
    as such may be incomplete.

[^5]:   <https://pronoun.is/yo>

[^6]:   This section is for pronoun sets that have no specific proposals for
        usage (as far as I know) but are still adopted by individuals for their
        own use. The list is mostly taken from [Pronoun Island][1].

[^7]:   James Rogers, "[That Impersonal Pronoun,][3]" _The Writer_ 4, 1 (Jan.
        1890): 12-13.

    >   **That Impersonal Pronoun.** &mdash; An impersonal pronoun, once in
        general use, would be such a great relief that few would care whether
        it were scientific or not. I prefer Nom. "e," poss. "es," obj.
        "em."[^16] First: In brevity it has been a clear advantage over any
        other I have seen offered. Secondly: "E" comes easily from "he,"
        nominative, singular; and "em" is a common shortening of the objective
        "them." I object to the proposed "thon." First: Because everyone has to
        be told how to pronounce it. Secondly: It is more than twice as long as
        "e," "es," "em." Thirdly: It is more difficult to speak, whether "th" be
        vocal or aspirate. Let us have the shortest and easiest. "Every writer
        has 'es' verbal likes and dislikes, yet, for the sake of convenience, I
        trust that even 'e' who dislikes verbal innovations will give my little
        word a little trial, and note for me the result." We may be sure that
        some such impersonal pronoun will eventually come. I say, "Let 'em'
        come."

[^8]:   Michael D. Spivak, Ph.D., _The Joy of TeX: A Gourmet Guide to
        Typesetting with the AMS-TeX Marcro Package_, 2 ed. (American
        Mathematical Society, 2004)[^9]: xv.

    >   Since $\TeX$ is a rather revolutionary approach to typesetting, I
        decided that a rather revolutionary approach to
        $\text{non-S}_\text{E}\text{Xist}$[^10] terminology would be appropriate
        in this manual. I myself am completely unprejudiced, of course. As Mark
        Twain said, or should have said: All I care to know is that a man or
        woman is a human being&mdash;that is enough for me; he or she can't be
        any worse. But I hate having to say "he or she" or "his or her" or
        using awkward circumlocutions. Numerous approached to this problem have
        been suggested, but one strikes me as particularly simple and sensible.
        Just as 'I' is the first person singular pronoun, regardless of gender,
        so 'E' will be used in this book as the third person singular pronoun
        for both genders.[^11] Thus, 'E' is the singular of 'they'.
        Accordingly, 'Eir' (pronounced to rhyme with 'their') will be the
        possessive, and 'Em' (rhyming with 'them') will stand for either 'him'
        or 'her'.[^16]

[^9]:   Earliest edition I could readily get my hands on was a corrected
        version of the second edition. [As far as I know][5], the "Personal
        Pronoun Pronouncement" section and the usage of E/Em pronouns in the
        book go back to the original draft in 1982.

[^10]:  Yes, the original contains a $\TeX$ pun. Yes, the formatting isn't
        entirely correct here, this document is not written entirely in
        $\LaTeX$ and is using MathJax to approximate the original (which is
        probably also why these logos are italicized, they should not be).

[^11]:  🙄.

[^12]:  "[An Explication (of sorts) for things Dicebox][6]," dicebox, accessed
        May 10, 2020.

    >   **Peh** (pê), pron. (nom. Peh; poss. Peh’s (pêz); obj. Pehm (pêm); pl.
        nom. They[^14] ([th][=a]); poss. Their or Theirs ([th]ârz or
        [th][=a]rz); obj. Them ([th]êm).) The entity previously designated,
        whose gender is indeterminate; a pronoun of indeterminate gender,
        usually referring to an antecedent[^13]. Note: used as a formality when
        assuming or noting the gender or sex of the antecedent is considered
        irrelevant to the subject at hand, i.e. government documentation, news
        reports, etc. (Cf. **it**, gender neutral pron.)

[^13]:  This was written for people who know linguistics but have never
        actually attempted to communicate or something.

[^14]:  Literally a completely different word, but go off, I guess. At least
        this inclusion helps clarify the phonetics, there is no key provided
        for the pronunciations here.

[^15]:  Sue Thomas, [_Hello World: Travels in Virtuality_][7], (Raw Nerve
        Books, 2004): 34.

    >   The original code for the spivak gender was written by a programmer
        called Rog. [...] I asked him once how spivak came about, and somehow
        it came as no surprise that this unusual little identity was created as
        a snippet in order to test the system [...]

    >   The short story is that, at some point back in '91 (hmm, has it really
        been 10 years? yikes...) when I was overhauling the `pronoun_sub` code
        - what's now `$gender_utils` was duplicated in about 10 different places and this offended me - I needed to test it out and so I created
        a bunch of extra, fake 'genders'. And when I was done, I left them in
        place, figuring that just having the usual male/female/neuter was
        boring, anyway. The Spivak set was something I half-remembered from a
        random textbook of his; though when I went back to check it, the only
        place I could actually find him using them was in the AMS-TeX Manual,
        which had a slightly different set from what I remembered (I distinctly
        recall him using 'hir' for the possessive, but the AMS-TeX book has
        'eir' so that's what it is, now...). And then, for some reason I can't
        quite fathom, the Spivak one caught on while the rest have been mostly
        ignored.

[^16]:  Oddly, a lot of proposals seem to be missing independent possessive and
        reflexive pronouns, which have seemingly been either inferred or
        appended by other proposals since.

        also have been infl by such a pron form as Yoruba: _awa_ 'we' (a
