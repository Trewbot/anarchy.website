title: Hina Change Ch. 11 English Comments
---

-   **1**: What's with all the hate for the MC, we've literally seen him have
    to struggle with having to hide his real self from society which insulted
    who he was. He avoided the girl because he didn't want to get attached to
    being a girl and force her to live her life the way he has had to.
    <br/>
    I bet if the story started with the backstory instead of startring with him
    being selfish people would have started sympathetic for him and been less
    harsh on him instead of started hating him and then disregarding the
    extenuating circumstances.
    -   **2:** No, it will just make it worse for the reader. Sure, he
        struggled with his sexuality and all that bullshit but literally nobody
        insulted him (at least not yet). If he came out the closet, nobody will
        bully him like his girl friend (I guess we'll never know since it has
        not happened yet). The only reason he feels bad is because the guy he
        likes is not a homo. Then what did he do to remedy this? He did not
        even blink and went ahead and switched bodies with his suffering friend
        and fucked the guy he likes not thinking of the consequenses. Yeah they
        had sex in chapter 1 and was also mentioned in ch 2. He's having the
        time of his life as a girl while the girl had to deal with the
        aftermath. He even had the audacity to make sure the "body" is in tip
        top shape so it feels good for the boyfriend to fuck it by giving her
        lotion.

    -   **1:** Did you just like, not read the last 4 chapters? Yah know, where
        he was told since kindergarten that boys liking boys was gross, and
        that he had to lie his entire life about who he was, and hated himself.
        <br/>
        The part where he had to keep himself away from his childhood friend
        because he didn't want to be tempted into steeling her future so that
        he could be happy. He didn't JUST switch with her to fuck the guy he
        likes. He had hope that he had found someone who would accept him for
        who he was, but then not only was he rejected, his feelings were
        treated like a joke. He snapped.
        <br/>
        He's not just sad cause he was rejected, he's a broken desperate depressed teenager.<br/>
        That doesn't mean he's a good guy, but I think he is a FAR more
        sympathetic character than people are giving him credit for.
    -   **3:** i do feel sorry for him,i don't hate him (yet) but i do find
        what he did was unacceptable, using his childhood friend's body, using
        it carelessly and making her losing her virginity without her consent.
        risking her to STD/AIDS or what if the guy was a jerk that spread
        rumors about her being a slut. good thing makoto is not that kind of
        guy, and yet what if he was that kind of guy? she is already an outcast
        things could have been worse for her. although things did not go that
        bad, it is still unacceptable. she just let him sleep with makoto
        because she loves ren to the point she would rather be the one who is
        hurt rather than him, and he knew she would, he knew he can use her, of
        course he felt guilty, but he still continue to use her. i don't hate
        him, but i can understand why people do.

    -   **4:** yeah no he absolutely deserves every bit of hate that people
        have for him. His actions are absolute unjustifiable and don’t warrant
        any compassion or sympathy from anyone. When someone makes decisions
        and choices we don’t allow them to get away with it because of WHY they
        made those choices.
        <br/>
        That’s called being a RESPONSIBLE human being. We all are accountable
        for our choices and don’t get to shirk the consequences because of what
        we felt or thought up until making them.
        <br/>
        He deserves to be held accountable and receive the consequences of his
        actions just like anyone else.

    -   **1:** You do realise he is a minor right, they don't have full legal
        responsibility for their action because they aren't mature yet.
        <br/>
        Also you do realise that the cause for someone's actions are VERY
        important. If you're starving, in most places if you get caught
        stealing food you can be exonerated in many jurisdictions for having a
        just reason. If you commit a crime of passion as opposed to a
        premeditated one you will get a lesser sentance in most places.
        <br/>
        This is because being companionate is part of being a REASONABLE human
        being.
        <br/>
        Again, I'm not saying he's a GOOD guy.
    -   **5:** This story is a whole lot of BS. The boy watched his female
        childhood friend suffer from being bullied and he watched because he
        didn't want to switch. Is that the only way to help a person? They
        could of been normal friends. The guy is a real Sh*t Face. He is not a
        real friend. He only saw his childhood friend as a tool for switching.
        I hate him so much.

    -   **6:** that's because you are retarded. If he helped Hina, he would get
        close to her again. And that's temptation to steal her life. It's like
        blaming a 1 year sober alcoholic for not going to the bar, even though
        his friend is there drinking away their problem. Sure, not a great
        thing to do, but first and foremost you have think about your own
        health and safety, others' second. And in this case, he thinks about
        Hina first, because he KNEW this will happen, all this shit people
        blame on him happened exactly as he imagined it would and why he kept
        his distance. He knew he would be too weak to resist snatching her life.
        <br/>
        He is a weak person, not a shitface.
    -   **7:** i feel sorry too but that fucker hurt her friend just because he
        wass embrassed of the society he cant help it its just genetic defect i
        hate that guy he just used her friend like a tool
-   **8:** Die fag!!
-   **9:** I really don't like this MC ... such a selfish prick è_é
